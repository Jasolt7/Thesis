  abstract = {This paper offers a summary of the latest studies on healthcare scheduling problems including patients' admission scheduling problem, nurse scheduling problem, operation room scheduling problem, surgery scheduling problem and other healthcare scheduling problems. The paper provides a comprehensive survey on healthcare scheduling focuses on the recent literature. The development of healthcare scheduling research plays a critical role in optimizing costs and improving the patient flow, providing prompt administration of treatment, and the optimal use of the resources provided and accessible in the hospitals. In the last decades, the healthcare scheduling methods that aim to automate the search for optimal resource management in hospitals by using metaheuristics methods have proliferated. However, the reported results are disintegrated since they solved every specific problem independently, given that there are many versions of problem definition and various data sets available for each of these problems. Therefore, this paper integrates the existing results by performing a comprehensive review and analyzing 190 articles based on four essential components in solving optimization problems: problem definition, formulations, data sets, and methods. This paper summarizes the latest healthcare scheduling problems focusing on patients' admission scheduling problems, nurse scheduling problems, and operation room scheduling problems considering these are the most common issues found in the literature. Furthermore, this review aims to help researchers to highlight some development from the most recent papers and grasp the new trends for future directions.},

The problem consists of a set of surgical operations that have to be scheduled in identical operating rooms. The operations have uncertain durations, require setup activities before and after the surgical act and are assigned to surgeons who have to perform the surgical part. The objective is to find the best sequence of operations in each room in order to minimize the theatre's opening duration (makespan) and the surgeons' waiting times. A stochastic mathematical model and a simulated annealing-based algorithm, where the uncertainty is represented using the sample average approximation technique, are provided. An experimental study carried out on real-sized instances shows that the method's solutions have respectable relative gaps in comparison with lower bounds and optimal solutions. {\ss} 2020 Canadian Operational Research Society (CORS)},

The problem is to find a schedule to minimize the makespan (\$\$C\_\{max\}\$\$), that is, the total completeness time of all jobs. The no-wait constraint occurs when two consecutive operations in a job must be processed without any waiting time either on or between machines. For this, we have proposed two different resolution methods, the first is an exact method based on the branch-and-bound algorithm, in which we have defined a new technique of branching. The second is a particular swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, extended from the discrete version of PSO. In the proposed algorithm, we have defined the particle and the velocity structures, and an efficient approach is developed to move a particle to the new position. Moreover, we have adapted the timetabling procedure to find a good solution while respecting the no-wait constraint. Using the PSO method, we have reached good results compared to those in the literature.},

On the one hand, dealing with hot liquid glass imposes no-wait constraints on some operations. On the other hand, skilled workers performing some manual tasks are modelled as special machines. The system produces approximate solutions in very short computing times, trying to minimize a non-regular criterion defined by the user and based on due dates.

The scheduling problem is solved by a decomposition into a timetabling algorithm and a sequence optimization procedure. For the timetabling task, where the sequence of products is assumed to be fixed, a new recursive algorithm to generate a non-delay feasible schedule is developed. The sequence optimization procedure searches for the optimum product sequence and makes heavy use of the timetabling algorithm. A competitive starting sequence is generated by a construction heuristic and iteratively improved by a tabu search algorithm.},

Some of the processing times are stochastic and the proposed solution effectively minimizes the makespan and increases the robustness of the makespan against deviating processing times. Therefore, a no-wait job shop with controllable deterministic processing times is solved by a decomposition into timetabling and sequencing. During timetabling, extra safety margins are added to the scheduled processing times without delaying jobs. In the sequence optimization subproblem, an extra penalty term is added to the cost function which punishes uncertain tasks at positions that have an impact on the makespan. Simulation results based on real plant data and tailor-made benchmark problems show that these measures can reduce the standard deviation of the makespan dramatically. This significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the scheduling method.},

A new model of the sequence-dependent operating room cleaning times that arise because of surgeries with different infection levels is considered. To solve this difficult integrated planning and scheduling problem, we devise a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm based on the time-indexed formulation of the problem. The basic column generation scheme relies on a label-correcting algorithm that we purposely developed for solving the pricing problems that are modeled as single operating room scheduling problems with time-dependent costs and sequence-dependent cleaning times. The pricing problems are strongly NP-Hard. The efficiency of the label-correcting algorithm is ensured by dominance rules among labels and by two algorithms for computing the upper and lower bound of labels. An effective cutting procedure, inspired by Benders' decomposition and based on duality theory for linear programming, is developed for tightening the linear relaxation of the problem. With instances from the literature and that we generated, we conduct a numerical study to demonstrate the computational effectiveness of the solution method. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This article presents a software tool to vary the number of anesthesia teams in different single or clustered operating rooms. Using the example of a university hospital it could be demonstrated that the simulated addition of one anesthesia team to different clusters of operations rooms resulted in an increase of 15-40 \% of operations and an increase up to 81 \% of utilization effectiveness.

In particular, great rel-evance has been given in literature to the Surgery Scheduling Problem (SPP). In its general form, it consists in determining a day, an operating room and a starting time of a set of surgeries. In this work, we address the SPP faced by a local hospital of Naples. The aim of the hospital is to determine a surgery schedule capable of handling unforeseeable events while maximizing the number of performed surg-eries, according to some medical guidelines. This problem has been modelled by an original integer linear programming formulation that has been tested and validated on several instances derived from real data provided by the hospital. Finally, the proposed formulation can be used to simulate different surgery operating scenarios. The results of this simulation can be used to provide useful managerial insights for an efficient schedule of the hospital surgeries. {\copyright} The Author(s).},

Hierarchical strategies have been proposed in the literature for complex scheduling problems, and the tabu search metaheuristic, being able to cope with different memory levels, provides a natural background for the development of a hierarchical algorithm. For the case considered, a two level approach has been devised, based on the decomposition in a routing and a job shop scheduling subproblem, which is obtained by assigning each operation of each job to one among the equivalent machines. Both problems are tackled by tabu search. Coordination issues between the two hierarchical levels are considered. Unlike other hierarchical schemes, which are based on a one-way information flow, the one proposed here is based on a two-way information flow. This characteristic, together with the flexibility of local search strategies like tabu search, allows to adapt the same basic algorithm to different objective functions.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Increasing value requires improving quality or decreasing costs. In surgery, estimates for the cost of 1 minute of operating room (OR) time vary widely. No benchmark exists for the cost of OR time, nor has there been a comprehensive assessment of what contributes to OR cost. OBJECTIVES: To calculate the cost of 1 minute of OR time, assess cost by setting and facility characteristics, and ascertain the proportion of costs that are direct and indirect. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis examined annual financial disclosure documents from all comparable short-term general and specialty care hospitals in California from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY2014 (N\,=\,3044; FY2014, n\,=\,302). The analysis focused on 2 revenue centers: (1) surgery and recovery and (2) ambulatory surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean cost of 1 minute of OR time, stratified by setting (inpatient vs ambulatory), teaching status, and hospital ownership. The proportion of cost attributable to indirect and direct expenses was identified; direct expenses were further divided into salary, benefits, supplies, and other direct expenses. RESULTS: In FY2014, a total of 175 of 302 facilities (57.9\%) were not for profit, 78 (25.8\%) were for profit, and 49 (16.2\%) were government owned. Thirty facilities (9.9\%) were teaching hospitals. The mean (SD) cost for 1 minute of OR time across California hospitals was \$37.45 (\$16.04) in the inpatient setting and \$36.14 (\$19.53) in the ambulatory setting (P\,=\,.65). There were no differences in mean expenditures when stratifying by ownership or teaching status except that teaching hospitals had lower mean (SD) expenditures than nonteaching hospitals in the inpatient setting (\$29.88 [\$9.06] vs \$38.29 [\$16.43]; P\,=\,.006). Direct expenses accounted for 54.6\% of total expenses (\$20.40 of \$37.37) in the inpatient setting and 59.1\% of total expenses (\$20.90 of \$35.39) in the ambulatory setting. Wages and benefits accounted for approximately two-thirds of direct expenses (inpatient, \$14.00 of \$20.40; ambulatory, \$14.35 of \$20.90), with nonbillable supplies accounting for less than 10\% of total expenses (inpatient, \$2.55 of \$37.37; ambulatory, \$3.33 of \$35.39). From FY2005 to FY2014, expenses in the OR have increased faster than the consumer price index and medical consumer price index. Teaching hospitals had slower growth in costs than nonteaching hospitals. Over time, the proportion of expenses dedicated to indirect costs has increased, while the proportion attributable to salary and supplies has decreased. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The mean cost of OR time is \$36 to \$37 per minute, using financial data from California's short-term general and specialty hospitals in FY2014. These statewide data provide a generalizable benchmark for the value of OR time. Furthermore, understanding the composition of costs will allow those interested in value improvement to identify high-yield targets.},

  abstract = {Background~           Operating rooms (ORs) are resource-intense and costly hospital units. Maximizing OR efficiency is essential to maintaining an economically viable institution. OR efficiency projects often focus on a limited number of ORs or cases. Efforts across an entire OR suite have not been reported. Lean and Six Sigma methodologies were developed in the manufacturing industry to increase efficiency by eliminating non-value-added steps. We applied Lean and Six Sigma methodologies across an entire surgical suite to improve efficiency.           Study Design~           A multidisciplinary surgical process improvement team constructed a value stream map of the entire surgical process from the decision for surgery to discharge. Each process step was analyzed in 3 domains, ie, personnel, information processed, and time. Multidisciplinary teams addressed 5 work streams to increase value at each step: minimizing volume variation; streamlining the preoperative process; reducing nonoperative time; eliminating redundant information; and promoting employee engagement. Process improvements were implemented sequentially in surgical specialties. Key performance metrics were collected before and after implementation.           Results~           Across 3 surgical specialties, process redesign resulted in substantial improvements in on-time starts and reduction in number of cases past 5 pm. Substantial gains were achieved in nonoperative time, staff overtime, and ORs saved. These changes resulted in substantial increases in margin/OR/day.           Conclusions~           Use of Lean and Six Sigma methodologies increased OR efficiency and financial performance across an entire operating suite. Process mapping, leadership support, staff engagement, and sharing performance metrics are keys to enhancing OR efficiency. The performance gains were substantial, sustainable, positive financially, and transferrable to other specialties.},

The problem is then to both assign operations to resources and sequence operations on the resources, in order to minimize the maximum completion time. A disjunctive graph representation of this problem is presented and a connected neighborhood structure is proposed. The latter can be used to derive a local search algorithm such as tabu search.

  abstract = {Simulated Annealing (SA) is one of the simplest and best-known metaheuristic method for addressing difficult black box global optimization problems whose objective function is not explicitly given and can only be evaluated via some costly computer simulation. It is massively used in real-life applications. The main advantage of SA is its simplicity. SA is based on an analogy with the physical annealing of materials that avoids the drawback of the Monte-Carlo approach (which can be trapped in local minima), thanks to an efficient Metropolis acceptance criterion. When the evaluation of the objective-function results from complex simulation processes that manipulate a large-dimension state space involving much memory, population-based algorithms are not applicable and SA is the right answer to address such issues. This chapter is an introduction to the subject. It presents the principles of local search optimization algorithms, of which simulated annealing is an extension, and the Metropolis algorithm, a basic component of SA. The basic SA algorithm for optimization is described together with two theoretical properties that are fundamental to SA: statistical equilibrium (inspired from elementary statistical physics) and asymptotic convergence (based on Markov chain theory). The chapter surveys the following practical issues of interest to the user who wishes to implement the SA algorithm for its particular application: finite-time approximation of the theoretical SA, polynomial-time cooling, Markov-chain length, stopping criteria, and simulation-based evaluations. To illustrate these concepts, this chapter presents the straightforward application of SA to two classical and simple classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the knapsack problem and the traveling salesman problem. The overall SA methodology is then deployed in detail on a real-life application: a large-scale aircraft trajectory planning problem involving nearly 30,000 flights at the European continental scale. This exemplifies how to tackle nowadays complex problems using the simple scheme of SA by exploiting particular features of the problem, by integrating astute computer implementation within the algorithm, and by setting user-defined parameters empirically, inspired by the SA basic theory presented in this chapter.},

We take into account the maximum daily working hours of surgeons, prevent the overlapping of surgeries performed by the same surgeon, allow time for the obligatory cleaning when switching from infectious to noninfectious cases, and respect the surgery deadlines. We formulate the problem using a mathematical programming model and develop a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm based on a constraint programming model for the sub-problem. We also develop dominance rules and a fast infeasibility-detection algorithm based on a multidimensional knapsack problem to improve the efficiency of the constraint programming model.

  abstract = {The operating room is a major cost and revenue center for most hospitals. Thus, more effective operating room management and scheduling can provide significant benefits. In many hospitals, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), where patients recover after their surgical procedures, is a bottleneck. If the PACU reaches capacity, patients must wait in the operating room until the PACU has available space, leading to delays and possible cancellations for subsequent operating room procedures. We develop a generalizable optimization and machine learning approach to sequence operating room procedures to minimize delays caused by PACU unavailability. Specifically, we use machine learning to estimate the required PACU time for each type of surgical procedure, we develop and solve two integer programming models to schedule procedures in the operating rooms to minimize maximum PACU occupancy, and we use discrete event simulation to compare our optimized schedule to the existing schedule. Using data from Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, we show that the scheduling system can significantly reduce operating room delays caused by PACU congestion while still keeping operating room utilization high: simulation of the second half of 2016 shows that our model could have reduced total PACU holds by 76\% without decreasing operating room utilization. We are currently working on implementing the scheduling system at the hospital. {\copyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Both planning too long and too short durations for surgeries lead to undesirable consequences, e.g. idle time, overtime, or rescheduling of surgeries. We define these consequences as operating room inefficiency. The overall objective of planning surgery durations is to minimize expected operating room inefficiency, since surgery durations are stochastic. While most health care studies assume economically rational behavior of decision makers, experimental studies have shown that decision makers often do not act according to economic incentives. Based on insights from health care operations management, medical decision making, behavioral operations management, as well as empirical observations, we derive hypotheses that surgeons' behavior deviates from economically rational behavior. To investigate this, we undertake an experimental study where experienced surgeons are asked to plan surgeries with uncertain durations. We discover systematic deviations from optimal decision making and offer behavioral explanations for the observed biases. Our research provides new insights to tackle a major problem in hospitals, i.e. low operating room utilization going along with staff overtime. {\copyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Objective: The objective of this work is to build a prediction model for Operating Room Time (ORT) to be used in an intelligent scheduling system. This prediction is a complex exercise due to its high variability and multiple influential variables. Materials and methods: We assessed a new strategy using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and clustering methods to identify subgroups of procedures and surgeries that are combined with prediction models to improve ORT estimates. Three tree-based models are assessed, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Conditional Random Forest (CFOREST) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), under two scenarios: (i) basic dataset of predictors and (ii) complete dataset with binary procedures. To evaluate the model, we use a test dataset and a training dataset to tune parameters. Results and discussion: The best results are obtained with GBM model using the complete dataset and the grouping variables, with an operational accuracy of 57.3\% in the test set. Conclusion: The results indicate the GBM model outperforms other models and it improves with the inclusion of the procedures as binary variables and the addition of the grouping variables obtained with LCA and hierarchical clustering that perform the identification of homogeneous groups of procedures and surgeries. {\copyright} 2022, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

Between 1997 and 2012, spending on these three sectors rose by \$580~billion, and employment rose by 1.7~million people. Just under half of all 2012 revenues were spent on labor compensation. The labor compensation share of spending declined slightly; within these sectors, the share of compensation paid to physicians and nurses increased. Although employment of nonprofessional labor grew during the study period, this group did not account for much of the sector's increased spending. The plurality of the 1997--2012 spending increase went to producers of purchased materials and services, which now account for more than one-third of payments.},

The Resource-Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (RCMPSP) consists of assigning start times to jobs corresponding to two or more projects that must be executed simultaneously while respecting the precedence between jobs and limited resources. The existing rise in the study of the RCMPSP resulted in numerous works on the topic while proposing different problem features. This research analyzes different variants of the problem based on aspects related to jobs, projects, relationships, resources, and time management. Moreover, based on the problem variants considered in the collected works, a taxonomy allowing (i) the identification and positioning of each RCMPSP variant and (ii) the analysis of the current state-of-the-art of the problem is proposed. In addition, the solution methods proposed to solve RCMPSPs are classified and analyzed, together with the benchmarks used to validate such approaches. Finally, this review paper discusses the RCMPSP connection to practice and provides future research opportunities in light of recent advances.},

Due to a computational limitation, the exact optimal model is then relaxed as a linear programming model. The output from the relaxation model then turns into the objective of the BIP-based real-time scheduling (RTS) heuristic model. The RTS heuristic requires an iteration to calculate the final C max. At each iteration, the RTS heuristic assigns just one job to the earliest available machines. Since the set of jobs and machines included in the RTS model is relatively small, RTS can be solved in a very short computational time. We evaluate an overall effectiveness (in terms of solution quality and run time) of the RTS heuristic by way of computer experiments.},

  abstract = {Objective One minute of operating room (OR) time costs \$36 to 37. However, ORs are notoriously inefficient. There is growing literature on improving OR efficiency, but no formal review of this topic within otolaryngology has been performed. This study reviews and synthesizes the current literature on improving OR efficiency within otolaryngology. Data Sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, preprints.org, and medRxiv were searched on November 4, 2022. Review Methods Published English studies were included if they reported on metrics for improving OR efficiency within otolaryngology. There were no publication date restrictions. Articles were screened by 2 reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis reporting for scoping reviews was followed. Results The search yielded 9316 no-duplicate articles; 129 articles were included. Most of the studies reported on head and neck procedures (n = 52/129). The main tactics included surgical considerations: hemostatic devices, techniques, and team/simultaneous approaches; anesthetic considerations: local anesthetic and laryngeal mask airways; procedure location considerations: procedures outside of the OR and remote technologies; standardization: equipment, checklists, and personnel; scheduling considerations: use of machine learning for booking, considering patient/surgeon factors, and utilizing dedicated OR time/multidisciplinary teams for on-call cases. Conclusion The current literature brings to attention numerous strategies for improving OR efficiency within otolaryngology. Applying these strategies and implementing novel techniques to manage surgical cases may assist in offloading overloaded health care systems and improving access to care while facilitating patient safety and outcomes. Anticipated barriers to implementation include resistance to change, funding, and the current strain on health care systems and providers.},

We develop two models, a stochastic recourse programming model and a two-stage stochastic optimization (SO) model with incorporated risk measure terms in the objective functions to determine a planning decision that is made to allocate surgical specialties to operating rooms (ORs). Our aim is to minimize the costs associated with postponements and unscheduled demands as well as the inefficient use of OR capacity. The results of these models are compared using a case of a real-life hospital to determine which model better copes with uncertainty. We propose a novel framework to transform the SO model based on its deterministic counterpart. Three SO models are proposed with respect to the variability and infeasibility of the measures of the objective function to encode the construction of the SO framework. The analysis of the experimental results demonstrates that the SO model offers better performance under a highly volatile demand environment than the recourse model. The originality of this work lies in its use of SO transformation framework and its development of stochastic models to address the problem of surgery capacity allocation based on a real case. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

To grasp the current development trend of the integrated FJSP (I-FJSP), this paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the I-FJSP and its extensions. In this context, 140 related articles were collected and analyzed. First, the mathematical model of the FJSP and the overview framework are presented. Subsequently, five different integration models of the FJSP are explained and corresponding qualitative analyses are conducted.

Focusing on elective patients, we determined the master surgical schedule (MSS) on a one-week time horizon. We assigned the specialties to available sessions and allocated surgeries to them while taking into consideration the priorities of the outpatients in the ambulatory surgical discipline. Surgeries were selected from the waiting lists according to their priorities. The proposed approach considered operating theater (OT) restrictions, patients' priorities and accounted for the availability of both intensive care unit (ICU) beds and post-surgery beds. Since the management decisions of hospitals are usually made in an uncertain environment, our approach considered the uncertainty of surgery duration and availability of ICU bed. Two robust optimization approaches that kept the model computationally tractable are described and applied to deal with uncertainty. Computational results based on a medium-sized French hospital archives have been presented to compare the robust models to the deterministic counterpart and to demonstrate the price of robustness. {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Portuguese National Health Plan outlines the urgency of improving the efficiency of the health care systems installed capacity, and reducing the waiting lists for surgery. This work aims to contribute to these objectives by developing a bicriteria optimization methodology that allows to streamline the surgery scheduling problem at a Lisbon public hospital. An evolutionary algorithm to approximate the set of non-dominated solutions of this bicriteria optimization problem is presented. Tests performed using hospital data show a good performance of the algorithm proposed. Instances with 508 to 2306 elective surgeries are solved in less than 80 seconds. A very good representation of the Pareto front was achieved thus providing the opportunity to implement a better decision-making process at the hospital. This study presents a powerful method with potential to improve the delivery of surgical activity in the hospital under study. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This plan seeks to ensure the best performance and adequacy of care maximizing the use of resources, quality, equity and access. This work results from a close collaboration with a large and publicly funded Portuguese hospital. The aim is to propose a systematic approach to help the surgical planner in the scheduling of elective surgeries, in order to optimize the use of the available surgical resources, and improve equity and access to operated and waiting patients. The decisions to be taken by this surgical case assignment problem are twofold: select patients to be scheduled in the planning horizon from a large waiting list for surgery; and assign a day, an operating room, and a time block to the selected patients. Three versions are modeled in (mixed) integer linear programming: from the administration's intention up to the surgeons' current practice, and a halfway reflecting a negotiation with the surgeons. A robust approach is proposed to tackle the uncertain surgeries' duration without the need to assume a given distribution for these random parameters and allowing to control the level of conservatism in the solutions. Practical and real-sized problems from the hospital are solved providing very good optimization gaps within a short time limit, both for the deterministic and robust approaches. The schedules obtained are analyzed regarding quality and robustness, and are also compared with the surgical schedules performed by the hospital.},

The aim of this work is to provide a contribution in the field of operations research to achieve these guidelines. The operating theater is a hospital unit that represents a great proportion of the hospital budget. Furthermore, it is a central service with connections and implications in the service of many other hospital units. Therefore, this work is dedicated to a case study of an elective surgery scheduling problem arising in a Portuguese public hospital. The problem consists of assigning an intervention date, an operating room and a starting time for elective surgeries that remain in the hospital waiting list, thus combining simultaneously advance and allocation scheduling. Two conflicting optimization criteria are independently considered: maximize the surgical suite occupation and maximize the number of surgeries scheduled. Two versions of a single objective genetic heuristic are developed and applied to real data from the studied hospital. The results show that this approach improves the quality of the hospital surgical plans in light of the objectives considered, requiring much fewer resources to construct the surgical plans. Real instances with 508-2306 elective surgeries are successfully solved in less than 240s. These are better results than authors' previous approaches to the same problem. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The persistent growth of HCE and concerns about its long-term fiscal sustainability highlight the necessity for policymakers to formulate effective cost containment strategies. To this end, identifying the factors that determine the growth of HCE and their size of impact is the first and most important step in curbing HCE growth. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the factors considered as determinants of HCE at the national level and to report their significance. Methods This study reviewed the empirical literature on determinants of HCE. Electronic databases including Scopus (Elsevier), PubMed/Medline, and ISI (Web of Science) were searched to retrieve articles published until November 2017. Results Thirty six primary articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Based on the findings, a wide range of factors explaining HCE growth including socio-demographic, economic, technological, environmental and lifestyle factors, factors associated with the epidemiological transition and changing patterns of diseases, factors related to the provision for health services, and factors concerning the administration and design of the health sector. Conclusions The review suggests the need for considering a wider range of issues while investigating HCE drivers, thereby shifting from factors traditionally considered as drivers of HCE to other explaining elements that their effects on HCE growth has been rarely examined. Although the trends and determinants of HCE have been widely examined in high-income countries, limited number of studies have investigated the issue at the aggregate level in developing countries.},

However, to the best our knowledge, only one contribution has addressed the operating room planning and scheduling problem with surgical teams, but in such case surgery durations did not depend on the experience of surgeons. In this paper we address an integrated operating room planning and scheduling problem with surgical teams composed by one or two surgeons where surgery durations depend on their experience and skills. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimally solve this problem. Given the high computation requirements of our MILP model, we also propose an iterative constructive method. In order to evaluate the performance of both exact and approximate methods, an extensive test bed is generated. The computational experience shows that the proposed algorithm is able to find feasible solution for all problems requiring shorter CPU time and average relative percentage deviation than the MILP model. Finally, the robustness of the so-obtained surgical schedules is analyzed using simulation. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the operating room planning problem at the tactical and operational decision levels considering upstream and downstream units. For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is proposed for the construction of master surgical scheduling and the allocation of elective and emergency surgeries. This model encompasses the profits of all stakeholders in the operating theater. A new policy, named complete opening policy, is introduced for the management of operating rooms that has some particular benefits compared to the conventional policy. Then, a scenario-based robust formulation is proposed to consider the uncertainties of surgery duration, length of stay and emergency demands. Because the simpler variants of this problem are known to be NP-complete, a new two-stage heuristic algorithm is developed for solving its large-scale instances. During the first stage, this algorithm generates an initial solution using a greedy constructive algorithm. To improve the initial solution, the algorithm applies eight actions and searches the neighborhoods. In the second stage, the algorithm evaluates whether or not closing an operating room could improve the incumbent solution. A heuristic algorithm, named partial-mixed integer programming, is also adapted as a benchmark algorithm. This algorithm incorporates the CPLEX solver and a very large-scale neighborhood search. Eventually, a hospital in Iran is introduced and evaluated. The computational results demonstrate that the application of the proposed methodology could potentially decrease the waiting cost, the overtime and idleness of operating rooms, and the total deviation from the average beds used in upstream and downstream. The computational results also show that an increase of two beds in the intensive care unit might potentially reduce the waiting cost by 3.6\% and the total average of overtime and idleness of operating rooms each day by 20.3\%.},

We consider the integrated optimization of logistics and production costs associated with the supply chain members. These problems routinely occur in a wide variety of industries including semiconductor manufacturing, multi-tier automotive supply chains, and consumer appliances to name a few. There are two types of decision variables: binary variables for selection of companies to form the supply chain and continuous variables associated with production planning. A scenario approach is used to handle the uncertainty of demand. The formulation is a robust optimization model with three components in the objective function: expected total costs, cost variability due to demand uncertainty, and expected penalty for demand unmet at the end of the planning horizon. The increase of computational time with the numbers of echelons and members per echelon necessitates a heuristic. A heuristic based on a k-shortest path algorithm is developed by using a surrogate distance to denote the effectiveness of each member in the supply chain. The heuristic can find an optimal solution very quickly in some small- and medium-size cases. For large problems, a "good" solution with a small gap relative to our lower bound is obtained in a short computational time. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background The growing demand for cancer surgery has placed a global strain on health systems. In-depth analyses of the global demand for cancer surgery and optimal workforce requirements are needed to plan service provision. We estimated the global demand for cancer surgery and the requirements for an optimal surgical and anaesthesia workforce, using benchmarks based on clinical guidelines. Methods Using models of benchmark surgical use based on clinical guidelines, we estimated the proportion of cancer cases with an indication for surgery across 183 countries, stratified by income group. These proportions were multiplied by age-adjusted national estimates of new cancer cases using GLOBOCAN 2018 data and then aggregated to obtain the estimated number of surgical procedures required globally. The numbers of cancer surgical procedures in 44 high-income countries were divided by the actual number of surgeons and anaesthetists in the respective countries to calculate cancer procedures per surgeon and anaesthetist ratios. Using the median (IQR) of these ratios as benchmarks, we developed a three-tiered optimal surgical and anaesthesia workforce matrix, and the predictions were extrapolated up to 2040. Findings Our model estimates that the number of cancer cases globally with an indication for surgery will increase by 5 million procedures (52\%) between 2018 (9\hphantom{,}065\hphantom{,}000) and 2040 (13\hphantom{,}821\hphantom{,}000). The greatest relative increase in surgical demand will occur in 34 low-income countries, where we also observed the largest gaps in workforce requirements. To match the median benchmark for high-income countries, the surgical workforce in these countries would need to increase by almost four times and the anaesthesia workforce by nearly 5{$\cdot$}5 times. The greatest increase in optimal workforce requirements from 2018 to 2040 will occur in low-income countries (from 28\hphantom{,}000 surgeons to 58\hphantom{,}000 surgeons; 107\% increase), followed by lower-middle-income countries (from 166\hphantom{,}000 surgeons to 277\hphantom{,}000 surgeons; 67\% increase). Interpretation The global demand for cancer surgery and the optimal workforce are predicted to increase over the next two decades and disproportionately affect low-income countries. These estimates provide an appropriate framework for planning the provision of surgical services for cancer worldwide.

  abstract = {Background: In hospital management, pinpointing steps that most enhance operating room (OR) throughput is challenging. While prior literature has utilized discrete event simulation (DES) to study specific strategies such as scheduling and resource allocation, our study examines an earlier planning phase, assessing all workflow stages to determine the most impactful steps for subsequent strategy development. Methods: DES models real-world systems by simulating sequential events. We constructed a DES model for thoracic, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic surgeries summarized from a tertiary Chinese hospital. The model covers preoperative preparations, OR occupation, and OR preparation. Parameters were sourced from patient data and staff experience. Model outcome is OR throughput. Post-validation, scenario analyses were conducted for each department, including: (1) improving preoperative patient preparation time; (2) increasing PACU beds; (3) improving OR preparation time; (4) use of new equipment to reduce the operative time of a selected surgery type; three levels of improvement (slight, moderate, large) were investigated. Results: The first three improvement scenarios resulted in a 1\%--5\% increase in OR throughput across the three departments. Large reductions in operative time of the selected surgery types led to approximately 12\%, 33\%, and 38\% increases in gastrointestinal, thoracic, and orthopedic surgery throughput, respectively. Moderate reductions resulted in 6\%--17\% increases in throughput and slight reductions of 1\%--7\%. Conclusions: The model could reliably reflect OR workflows of the three departments. Among the options investigated, model simulations suggest that improving OR preparation time and operative time are the most effective. {\copyright} 2024 International Society of Surgery/Soci{\'e}t{\'e} Internationale de Chirurgie (ISS/SIC).},

  abstract = {Introducing Lean management (LM) enables the surgical process to reach considerably high levels of performance and efficiency, in addition to increased patient safety and satisfaction among healthcare professionals. This contribution presents a consolidated model of LM which has proved highly successful in improving both overall efficiency in operation rooms and patients' perceived value of efficient hospital care. This model is based on a real case study carried out over a 3-year period. A surgical process improvement team was set up, which then designed a Process Value Flow Map using LM tools, and detected opportunities for improvement. The map reflects the patient's journey through the process, the flow of information and materials for optimising processes. Findings from the three improvement projects described in the paper were used to (1) enhance waiting list management, (2) improve operating room scheduling criteria and sharing of surgical resources, and (3) create continuous improvement teams. The results of the study are twofold: (1) reduced waiting times for operations and (2) increased efficiency of operating rooms stemming from a cultural change in surgical resources management, particularly activity planning. A notable increase in surgical efficiency indicators was also observed, as well as the need to incorporate Lean principles into surgical intervention programming.},

  abstract = {Problem/Issue: Product costs are a portion of the annually increasing costs of medical care. With diligent analysis of product costs, including the cost of time to use the product, the surgeon can reduce these spiraling costs. The purpose of this study was to provide the surgeon with the necessary information to make informed decisions about time- and cost-efficient products. Materials and Methods: This study involved phoning, faxing, or e-mailing hospitals and anesthesia groups across the United States to obtain time-dependent costs in the hospital operating room. Operating room fees charged by the hospital and anesthesiologist professional fees are included. Various products were then relatively compared with the time needed to prepare, use, or apply the product. Time and cost factors were then compared in order to ascertain the most time- and cost-effective products. Findings: The findings revealed an average of \$62 per minute (rounded to the closest dollar) for the hospital operating room fee (range \$21.80--\$133.12) and \$4 per minute for the anesthesiologist professional fee (range \$2.20--\$6.10), with a total of \$66 per minute. This figure represents a marked increase from the 1991 rate of \$20 per minute. Generalizations from this study indicate that time-cost efficiency is seen more so in kits (trays) than in nonkits and more so in disposables than in durables. Products that require fewer people are more time-cost efficient than those that require more people, and products that require fewer steps are more time-cost efficient than those that require more steps. Specific findings included time and cost dominance for the following products: staples over sutures, direct-current cautery over alternating-current cautery, syringes over Dermajet or Madajet, MagneSplint over suturing the nasal septum, aluminum-Velcro or aluminumfoam Denver Splint and Xomed Bridgemaster over any of the polypropylene heat-sensitive splints, Rhino Rocket and Merocel over Vaseline gauze, Brennan RhinoCath over manual blood removal, 1-piece Biplane liposuction cannulas over any 2-piece type, Doyle ear-dressing kit over component parts, Dale nasal dressing over component parts, preformed implants over manual forming, and Denver Splint kits over component parts. Conclusions: Each hospital or private suite will have different charges, and the range of product choices for each surgeon will be different. However, the principle is the same: If you save time, you will save money. In addition to the monetary benefit, the patient will be safer and receive less anesthesia, and the surgeon will have more time for his or her own social or professional life. Each surgeon should analyze the product choices and choose those products that will deliver quality care in less time. To save more than \$100 000, the surgeon has to save only approximately 7 minutes per case on 250 cases.},

This work uses a case study of a large Australian public hospital with long surgical waiting lists and high levels of non-elective demand. Due to the complexity of the SCSP and the size of the instances considered herein, heuristic techniques are required to solve the problem. We present constructive heuristics based on both a modified block scheduling policy and an open scheduling policy. A number of real-time reactive strategies are presented that can be used to maintain schedule feasibility in the case of disruptions. Results of computational experiments show that this approach maintains schedule feasibility in real-time, whilst increasing operating theatre (OT) utilisation and throughput, and reducing the waiting time of non-elective patients. The framework presented here is applicable to the real-life scheduling of OT departments, and we provide recommendations regarding implementation of the approach. {\copyright} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We consider a multiple objective perspective where the number of ATCos is fixed in advance and a set of ATCo labor conditions have to be satisfied. The objectives deal with the ATCo work and rest periods and positions, the structure of the solution, the number of control center changes, or the distribution of the ATCo workloads. We propose a three-phase problem-solving methodology. In the first phase, a heuristic is used to derive infeasible initial solutions on the basis of templates. Then, a multiple independent run of the simulated annealing metaheuristic is conducted aimed at reaching feasible solutions in the second phase. Finally, a multiple independent simulated annealing run is again conducted from the initial feasible solutions to optimize the objective functions. To do this, we transform the multiple to single optimization problem by using the rank-order centroid function. In the search processes in phases 2 and 3, we use regular expressions to check the ATCo labor conditions in the visited solutions. This provides high testing speed. The proposed approach is illustrated using a real example, and the optimal solution which is reached outperforms an existing template-based reference solution.},

The solution structure should resemble the previous template-based solution. Initial infeasible solutions are built using a template-based heuristic in Phase 1. Then, VNS is conducted in Phase 2 in order to arrive at a feasible solution. This constitutes the starting point of a new search process carried out in Phase 3 to derive an optimal solution based on a weighted sum fitness function.

As part of this, hospitals are faced with the daunting task of planning operating room patients with budget, time and personnel. Most of the scheduling problems are NP-hard, so researchers have favored the development of heuristics and meta-heuristics to the detriment of exact methods. In a context where high performance computers are in continuous improvement, it is once again interesting to explore exact methods. Here we focus on developing exact methods for solving the operating room planning and scheduling problem. Our contribution is to develop first an accelerated Integer Linear Program (ILP) using the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) meta-heuristic to optimize patient waiting time according to the priority of their surgeries. Afterwards, we expose a new lower bound obtained by optimizing the patient waiting time relaxed. The experimental results validated the performance of the accelerated ILP in comparison with the original ILP. Furthermore, we have shown that the Lagrangian relaxation of the original ILP produces a lower bound of good quality. {\copyright} 2022 ACM.},

Design/methodology/approach: A discrete-event simulation model was developed to understand how changes to the MSS would affect bed occupancy, thereby providing business intelligence for short- and long-term hospital planning. A decision tool was subsequently developed for hospital managers to test different scenarios. Findings: Simulation modelling showed that significant bed occupancy levelling could be achieved through small and practicable changes to the MSS. Optimisation routines conducted using the simulation model then gave additional insights into how the schedule should be revamped for the long term. Practical implications: The authors show how operations research methods are useful for guiding hospital operational planning. The authors show that a data-driven and evidence-based model enables hospital managers to critically explore various scheduling changes, while also providing a scientific common ground for discussion among important stakeholders. It is a crucial step forward when adopting advanced analytics for Hong Kong hospital operational planning. Originality/value: The authors provide a robust method for evaluating the relationship between Hong Kong hospital's MSS and its bed occupancy. Through simulating various changes to the surgical schedule, valuable and practicable insights were made available for hospital managers to make short- and longer-term changes that enhance the system's overall efficiency and service quality. {\copyright} 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Planning operating theatres and scheduling surgeries play a crucial role in hospital management. Operating theatres generate the most revenue for hospitals while demanding significant resources. This study investigates the optimal plan for flexible operating rooms (ORs) as a shared resource between elective and emergency patients. Elective operations might be planned weeks or months in advance. An emergency operation, on the other hand, must be performed as soon as possible. In this study, the uncertainty in parameters, such as emergency arrivals and surgery durations, has been considered. Based on the historical data obtained from a local hospital in Australia, we fitted lognormal distributions to surgery durations and Poisson distributions to emergency case arrivals. A stochastic programming model is developed to optimise the assignment of selected elective patients to surgical blocks considering the emergency arrivals with the objective of minimising the total cost of conducting or postponing surgeries and overtime. The surgical blocks are obtained from a master surgery schedule (MSS) which is determined at the tactical level of OR scheduling for several months. Each block is combinations of weekday/time, surgical specialty, and ORs. To distinguish the patients on the waiting list, a priority factor has been determined for each patient considering their surgical specialty, their actual waiting time, and their urgency level. Emergency patients have higher priority compared to the elective case with the same attributes. To preventively manage the random arrivals of emergency cases, most of the literature applied a Break-In-Moment (BIM) methodology in which finish times of surgeries in blocks are distributed in a way that maximises the insertion opportunities for emergency case arrivals. However, this methodology cannot be considered as a highly responsive-preventive methodology when the lengths of surgeries appear to be long as it may reduce opportunities for emergency case insertions. The proposed solution in this paper considers buffer time in each surgical block as a preventive methodology for emergency case arrivals. These buffer times can be divided into several parts and can be inserted into the plan every few hours, or they can be used as a whole time at the end of block time. In this paper, at first, we run the model deterministically to obtain good estimates of buffer time for each block. Then we run the model stochastically using the buffer times from the deterministic model and the random data obtained from distribution functions of the random parameters. By considering this scenario as a base, varying the buffer times and solving each scenario stochastically, we found that increasing the amounts of buffer times did not change the objective function significantly, however reducing them changed the objective function noticeably. Based on this, solving the model deterministically at first can give us a good estimation of buffer time for preventive scheduling for emergency case in flexible ORs. {\copyright} 2023 Proceedings of the International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM.

  abstract = {Objective: Assess the impact of the implementation of a data-driven scheduling strategy that aimed to improve the access to care of nonelective surgical patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Background: Between July 2009 and June 2010, MGH experienced increasing throughput challenges in its perioperative environment: approximately 30\% of the nonelective patients were waiting more than the prescribed amount of time to get to surgery, hampering access to care and aggravating the lack of inpatient beds. Methods: This work describes the design and implementation of an "open block" strategy: operating room (OR) blocks were reserved for nonelective patients during regular working hours (prime time) and their management centralized. Discrete event simulation showed that 5 rooms would decrease the percentage of delayed patients from 30\% to 2\%, assuming that OR availability was the only reason for preoperative delay. Results: Implementation began in January 2012. We compare metrics for June through December of 2012 against the samemonths of 2011. The average preoperative wait time of all nonelective surgical patients decreased by 25.5\% (P {$<$} 0.001), even with a volume increase of 9\%. The number of bed-days occupied by nonurgent patients before surgery declined by 13.3\% whereas the volume increased by 4.5\%. Conclusions: The large-scale application of an open-block strategy significantly improved the flow of nonelective patients atMGHwhen OR availability was a major reason for delay. Rigorous metrics were developed to evaluate its performance. Strong managerial leadership was crucial to enact the new practices and turn them into organizational change.
