  abstract = {We study single machine scheduling problems with generalized due-dates. The scheduling measure is minimum total late work. We show that unlike the classical version (assuming job-specific due-dates), this problem has a polynomial time solution. Then, the problem is extended to allow job rejection. First, an upper bound on the total permitted rejection cost is assumed. Then we study the setting whereby the rejection cost is part of the objective function, which becomes minimizing the sum of total late work and rejection cost. We prove that both versions are NP-hard, and introduce pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming solution algorithms. We then consider a setting in which the machine is not available for some period (e.g., due to maintenance). Again, a pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming is introduced for the (NP-hard) problem of minimizing total late work with generalized due-dates and unavailability period. These dynamic programming algorithms are tested numerically, and proved to perform well on problems of various input parameters. Then, the extension to the weighted case, i.e., the problem of minimizing total weighted late work with generalized due-dates is proved to be NP-hard. Finally, we study a slightly different setting, in which the given due-dates are assigned to jobs, but there is no restriction on their order, i.e., the j-th due-date is not necessarily assigned to the j-th job in the sequence. We show that this problem (known as scheduling assignable due-dates) to minimize total late work is NP-hard as well.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a summary of the latest studies on healthcare scheduling problems including patients' admission scheduling problem, nurse scheduling problem, operation room scheduling problem, surgery scheduling problem and other healthcare scheduling problems. The paper provides a comprehensive survey on healthcare scheduling focuses on the recent literature. The development of healthcare scheduling research plays a critical role in optimizing costs and improving the patient flow, providing prompt administration of treatment, and the optimal use of the resources provided and accessible in the hospitals. In the last decades, the healthcare scheduling methods that aim to automate the search for optimal resource management in hospitals by using metaheuristics methods have proliferated. However, the reported results are disintegrated since they solved every specific problem independently, given that there are many versions of problem definition and various data sets available for each of these problems. Therefore, this paper integrates the existing results by performing a comprehensive review and analyzing 190 articles based on four essential components in solving optimization problems: problem definition, formulations, data sets, and methods. This paper summarizes the latest healthcare scheduling problems focusing on patients' admission scheduling problems, nurse scheduling problems, and operation room scheduling problems considering these are the most common issues found in the literature. Furthermore, this review aims to help researchers to highlight some development from the most recent papers and grasp the new trends for future directions.},

The problem consists of a set of surgical operations that have to be scheduled in identical operating rooms. The operations have uncertain durations, require setup activities before and after the surgical act and are assigned to surgeons who have to perform the surgical part. The objective is to find the best sequence of operations in each room in order to minimize the theatre's opening duration (makespan) and the surgeons' waiting times. A stochastic mathematical model and a simulated annealing-based algorithm, where the uncertainty is represented using the sample average approximation technique, are provided. An experimental study carried out on real-sized instances shows that the method's solutions have respectable relative gaps in comparison with lower bounds and optimal solutions. {\ss} 2020 Canadian Operational Research Society (CORS)},

The problem is to find a schedule to minimize the makespan (\$\$C\_\{max\}\$\$), that is, the total completeness time of all jobs. The no-wait constraint occurs when two consecutive operations in a job must be processed without any waiting time either on or between machines. For this, we have proposed two different resolution methods, the first is an exact method based on the branch-and-bound algorithm, in which we have defined a new technique of branching. The second is a particular swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, extended from the discrete version of PSO. In the proposed algorithm, we have defined the particle and the velocity structures, and an efficient approach is developed to move a particle to the new position. Moreover, we have adapted the timetabling procedure to find a good solution while respecting the no-wait constraint. Using the PSO method, we have reached good results compared to those in the literature.},

On the one hand, dealing with hot liquid glass imposes no-wait constraints on some operations. On the other hand, skilled workers performing some manual tasks are modelled as special machines. The system produces approximate solutions in very short computing times, trying to minimize a non-regular criterion defined by the user and based on due dates.

The scheduling problem is solved by a decomposition into a timetabling algorithm and a sequence optimization procedure. For the timetabling task, where the sequence of products is assumed to be fixed, a new recursive algorithm to generate a non-delay feasible schedule is developed. The sequence optimization procedure searches for the optimum product sequence and makes heavy use of the timetabling algorithm. A competitive starting sequence is generated by a construction heuristic and iteratively improved by a tabu search algorithm.},

Some of the processing times are stochastic and the proposed solution effectively minimizes the makespan and increases the robustness of the makespan against deviating processing times. Therefore, a no-wait job shop with controllable deterministic processing times is solved by a decomposition into timetabling and sequencing. During timetabling, extra safety margins are added to the scheduled processing times without delaying jobs. In the sequence optimization subproblem, an extra penalty term is added to the cost function which punishes uncertain tasks at positions that have an impact on the makespan. Simulation results based on real plant data and tailor-made benchmark problems show that these measures can reduce the standard deviation of the makespan dramatically. This significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the scheduling method.},

A new model of the sequence-dependent operating room cleaning times that arise because of surgeries with different infection levels is considered. To solve this difficult integrated planning and scheduling problem, we devise a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm based on the time-indexed formulation of the problem. The basic column generation scheme relies on a label-correcting algorithm that we purposely developed for solving the pricing problems that are modeled as single operating room scheduling problems with time-dependent costs and sequence-dependent cleaning times. The pricing problems are strongly NP-Hard. The efficiency of the label-correcting algorithm is ensured by dominance rules among labels and by two algorithms for computing the upper and lower bound of labels. An effective cutting procedure, inspired by Benders' decomposition and based on duality theory for linear programming, is developed for tightening the linear relaxation of the problem. With instances from the literature and that we generated, we conduct a numerical study to demonstrate the computational effectiveness of the solution method. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

To improve the algorithm, a new strategy inspired from selfish herd (SH) theory was used to update the pheromones in the algorithm. Scheduling WOs in a transportation workshop is similar to a job shop scheduling problem. Therefore, the structure of this special case was chosen to evaluate the new method. The proposed approach was evaluated in five test cases and numerical computational experiments. The performance of the improved ACO algorithm was compared in all test cases, including small and large test cases. The computational experiments show that the algorithms modified with the SH strategy outperformed the same algorithms without this strategy.

In this context, Operations Research methodologies can play a relevant role supporting hospital executives in operating room management and surgery scheduling issues. In particular, great rel-evance has been given in literature to the Surgery Scheduling Problem (SPP). In its general form, it consists in determining a day, an operating room and a starting time of a set of surgeries. In this work, we address the SPP faced by a local hospital of Naples. The aim of the hospital is to determine a surgery schedule capable of handling unforeseeable events while maximizing the number of performed surg-eries, according to some medical guidelines. This problem has been modelled by an original integer linear programming formulation that has been tested and validated on several instances derived from real data provided by the hospital. Finally, the proposed formulation can be used to simulate different surgery operating scenarios. The results of this simulation can be used to provide useful managerial insights for an efficient schedule of the hospital surgeries. {\copyright} The Author(s).},

The planning of operating rooms is a difficult process. Its real complexity results from various sources of variability. In this work, we consider one of the key sources of variability, specifically emergencies. Due to non-elective surgeries arrival, the operating room schedule has to be adjusted. Thus, need for a decision support tool, guiding the operating room manager, to handle this unpredictable flow of patients, arises. The main contribution of this work is to provide online assignment strategies, taking into account three non-elective patient's categories. The proposed assignments are riskless on patient's health. According to the non-elective surgery category, the proposed adjusted schedule minimizes different criteria, such as patient's waiting time, deviation from the scheduled start time of a surgery and the amount of resulting overtime. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Hierarchical strategies have been proposed in the literature for complex scheduling problems, and the tabu search metaheuristic, being able to cope with different memory levels, provides a natural background for the development of a hierarchical algorithm. For the case considered, a two level approach has been devised, based on the decomposition in a routing and a job shop scheduling subproblem, which is obtained by assigning each operation of each job to one among the equivalent machines. Both problems are tackled by tabu search. Coordination issues between the two hierarchical levels are considered. Unlike other hierarchical schemes, which are based on a one-way information flow, the one proposed here is based on a two-way information flow. This characteristic, together with the flexibility of local search strategies like tabu search, allows to adapt the same basic algorithm to different objective functions. Preliminary computational experience is reported.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Increasing value requires improving quality or decreasing costs. In surgery, estimates for the cost of 1 minute of operating room (OR) time vary widely. No benchmark exists for the cost of OR time, nor has there been a comprehensive assessment of what contributes to OR cost. OBJECTIVES: To calculate the cost of 1 minute of OR time, assess cost by setting and facility characteristics, and ascertain the proportion of costs that are direct and indirect. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis examined annual financial disclosure documents from all comparable short-term general and specialty care hospitals in California from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY2014 (N\,=\,3044; FY2014, n\,=\,302). The analysis focused on 2 revenue centers: (1) surgery and recovery and (2) ambulatory surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean cost of 1 minute of OR time, stratified by setting (inpatient vs ambulatory), teaching status, and hospital ownership. The proportion of cost attributable to indirect and direct expenses was identified; direct expenses were further divided into salary, benefits, supplies, and other direct expenses. RESULTS: In FY2014, a total of 175 of 302 facilities (57.9\%) were not for profit, 78 (25.8\%) were for profit, and 49 (16.2\%) were government owned. Thirty facilities (9.9\%) were teaching hospitals. The mean (SD) cost for 1 minute of OR time across California hospitals was \$37.45 (\$16.04) in the inpatient setting and \$36.14 (\$19.53) in the ambulatory setting (P\,=\,.65). There were no differences in mean expenditures when stratifying by ownership or teaching status except that teaching hospitals had lower mean (SD) expenditures than nonteaching hospitals in the inpatient setting (\$29.88 [\$9.06] vs \$38.29 [\$16.43]; P\,=\,.006). Direct expenses accounted for 54.6\% of total expenses (\$20.40 of \$37.37) in the inpatient setting and 59.1\% of total expenses (\$20.90 of \$35.39) in the ambulatory setting. Wages and benefits accounted for approximately two-thirds of direct expenses (inpatient, \$14.00 of \$20.40; ambulatory, \$14.35 of \$20.90), with nonbillable supplies accounting for less than 10\% of total expenses (inpatient, \$2.55 of \$37.37; ambulatory, \$3.33 of \$35.39). From FY2005 to FY2014, expenses in the OR have increased faster than the consumer price index and medical consumer price index. Teaching hospitals had slower growth in costs than nonteaching hospitals. Over time, the proportion of expenses dedicated to indirect costs has increased, while the proportion attributable to salary and supplies has decreased. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The mean cost of OR time is \$36 to \$37 per minute, using financial data from California's short-term general and specialty hospitals in FY2014. These statewide data provide a generalizable benchmark for the value of OR time. Furthermore, understanding the composition of costs will allow those interested in value improvement to identify high-yield targets.},

OR efficiency projects often focus on a limited number of ORs or cases. Efforts across an entire OR suite have not been reported. Lean and Six Sigma methodologies were developed in the manufacturing industry to increase efficiency by eliminating non-value-added steps. We applied Lean and Six Sigma methodologies across an entire surgical suite to improve efficiency.           Study Design~           A multidisciplinary surgical process improvement team constructed a value stream map of the entire surgical process from the decision for surgery to discharge. Each process step was analyzed in 3 domains, ie, personnel, information processed, and time. Multidisciplinary teams addressed 5 work streams to increase value at each step: minimizing volume variation; streamlining the preoperative process; reducing nonoperative time; eliminating redundant information; and promoting employee engagement. Process improvements were implemented sequentially in surgical specialties. Key performance metrics were collected before and after implementation.           Results~           Across 3 surgical specialties, process redesign resulted in substantial improvements in on-time starts and reduction in number of cases past 5 pm. Substantial gains were achieved in nonoperative time, staff overtime, and ORs saved. These changes resulted in substantial increases in margin/OR/day.           Conclusions~           Use of Lean and Six Sigma methodologies increased OR efficiency and financial performance across an entire operating suite. Process mapping, leadership support, staff engagement, and sharing performance metrics are keys to enhancing OR efficiency. The performance gains were substantial, sustainable, positive financially, and transferrable to other specialties.},

  abstract = {The job shop scheduling problem is one of the most studied optimization problems to this day and it becomes more and more important in the light of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) that aims at fully automated production processes. For a long time exact methods like constraint programming had problems to solve real large-scale problem instances and methods of choice were to be found in the area of (meta-) heuristics. However, developments during the last decade improved the performance of state-of-the-art constraint solvers dramatically, to the point that they can be applied also on large-scale instances. The presented work's main target is to elaborate the performance of state-of-the-art constraint solvers with respect to industrial-size job shop scheduling problem instances. To this end, we analyze and compare the performance of two cutting-edge constraint solvers: OR-Tools, an open-source solver developed by Google and recurrent winner of the MiniZinc Challenge, and CP Optimizer, a proprietary constraint solver from IBM targeted at industrial optimization problems. In order to reflect real-world industrial scenarios with heavy workloads like found in the semi-conductor domain, we use novel benchmarks that comprise up to one million operations to be scheduled on up to one thousand machines. The comparison is based on the best makespan (i.e.~completion time) achieved and the time required to solve the problem instances. We test the solvers on single-core and quad-core configurations.},

The problem is to assign each operation to a machine and to sequence the operations on the machines, such that the makespan of a set of jobs is minimized. We introduce an extended version of the disjunctive graph model, that is able to take into account the fact that operations have to be assigned to machines. This allows us to present an integrated approach, by defining a neighborhood structure for the problem where there is no distinction between reassigning or resequencing an operation. This neighborhood is proved to be connected. A tabu search procedure is proposed and computational results are provided.},

  abstract = {Simulated Annealing (SA) is one of the simplest and best-known metaheuristic method for addressing difficult black box global optimization problems whose objective function is not explicitly given and can only be evaluated via some costly computer simulation. It is massively used in real-life applications. The main advantage of SA is its simplicity. SA is based on an analogy with the physical annealing of materials that avoids the drawback of the Monte-Carlo approach (which can be trapped in local minima), thanks to an efficient Metropolis acceptance criterion. When the evaluation of the objective-function results from complex simulation processes that manipulate a large-dimension state space involving much memory, population-based algorithms are not applicable and SA is the right answer to address such issues. This chapter is an introduction to the subject. It presents the principles of local search optimization algorithms, of which simulated annealing is an extension, and the Metropolis algorithm, a basic component of SA. The basic SA algorithm for optimization is described together with two theoretical properties that are fundamental to SA: statistical equilibrium (inspired from elementary statistical physics) and asymptotic convergence (based on Markov chain theory). The chapter surveys the following practical issues of interest to the user who wishes to implement the SA algorithm for its particular application: finite-time approximation of the theoretical SA, polynomial-time cooling, Markov-chain length, stopping criteria, and simulation-based evaluations. To illustrate these concepts, this chapter presents the straightforward application of SA to two classical and simple classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the knapsack problem and the traveling salesman problem. The overall SA methodology is then deployed in detail on a real-life application: a large-scale aircraft trajectory planning problem involving nearly 30,000 flights at the European continental scale. This exemplifies how to tackle nowadays complex problems using the simple scheme of SA by exploiting particular features of the problem, by integrating astute computer implementation within the algorithm, and by setting user-defined parameters empirically, inspired by the SA basic theory presented in this chapter.},

This study formulates the no-wait job shop problem with a total flow time criterion based on time difference and decomposes the problem into timetabling and sequencing subproblems. Several timetabling methods are designed for the total flow time criterion to generate a sequence timetable. By adopting favourable features of the iterated greedy algorithm, the population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm for the sequencing subproblem is proposed. The individuals in the population evolve by means of a destruction and construction perturbator and an insertion-based local search. In each iteration, a tournament selection is designed to replace a relatively worse solution. In order to generate starting solutions with a certain quality and diversity, the Nawaz--Enscore--Ham-based heuristics for flow shop scheduling are extended in no-wait job shops. In computational experiments based on well-known benchmark instances, timetabling methods are investigated, and it is shown that the left timetabling is superior to other timetabling methods for the total flow time minimisation. Computational results also show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art metaheuristics, and it could be applicable to practical production environment.},

We take into account the maximum daily working hours of surgeons, prevent the overlapping of surgeries performed by the same surgeon, allow time for the obligatory cleaning when switching from infectious to noninfectious cases, and respect the surgery deadlines. We formulate the problem using a mathematical programming model and develop a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm based on a constraint programming model for the sub-problem. We also develop dominance rules and a fast infeasibility-detection algorithm based on a multidimensional knapsack problem to improve the efficiency of the constraint programming model.

Since the commencement of the first set of classical metaheuristic algorithms namely genetic, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing and tabu search in the early 70s to late 90s, several new advancements have been recorded with an exponential growth in the novel proposals of new generation metaheuristic algorithms. Because these algorithms are neither entirely judged based on their performance values nor according to the useful insight they may provide, but rather the attention is given to the novelty of the processes they purportedly models, these area of study will continue to periodically see the arrival of several new similar techniques in the future. However, there is an obvious reason to keep track of the progressions of these algorithms by collating their general algorithmic profiles in terms of design inspirational source, classification based on swarm or evolutionary search concept, existing variation from the original design, and application areas. In this paper, we present a relatively new taxonomic classification list of both classical and new generation sets of metaheuristic algorithms available in the literature, with the aim of providing an easily accessible collection of popular optimization tools for the global optimization research community who are at the forefront in utilizing these tools for solving complex and difficult real-world problems.

  abstract = {The operating room is a major cost and revenue center for most hospitals. Thus, more effective operating room management and scheduling can provide significant benefits. In many hospitals, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), where patients recover after their surgical procedures, is a bottleneck. If the PACU reaches capacity, patients must wait in the operating room until the PACU has available space, leading to delays and possible cancellations for subsequent operating room procedures. We develop a generalizable optimization and machine learning approach to sequence operating room procedures to minimize delays caused by PACU unavailability. Specifically, we use machine learning to estimate the required PACU time for each type of surgical procedure, we develop and solve two integer programming models to schedule procedures in the operating rooms to minimize maximum PACU occupancy, and we use discrete event simulation to compare our optimized schedule to the existing schedule. Using data from Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, we show that the scheduling system can significantly reduce operating room delays caused by PACU congestion while still keeping operating room utilization high: simulation of the second half of 2016 shows that our model could have reduced total PACU holds by 76\% without decreasing operating room utilization. We are currently working on implementing the scheduling system at the hospital. {\copyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Scheduling for the flexible job shop is very important in both fields of production management and combinatorial optimization. However, it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem in medium and actual size problem with traditional optimization approaches owing to the high computational complexity. For solving the realistic case with more than two jobs, two types of approaches have been used: hierarchical approaches and integrated approaches. In hierarchical approaches assignment of operations to machines and the sequencing of operations on the resources or machines are treated separately, i.e., assignment and sequencing are considered independently, where in integrated approaches, assignment and sequencing are not differentiated. In this paper, a mathematical model and heuristic approaches for flexible job shop scheduling problems (FJSP) are considered. Mathematical model is used to achieve optimal solution for small size problems. Since FJSP is NP-hard problem, two heuristics approaches involve of integrated and hierarchical approaches are developed to solve the real size problems. Six different hybrid searching structures depending on used searching approach and heuristics are presented in this paper. Numerical experiments are used to evaluate the performance of the developed algorithms. It is concluded that, the hierarchical algorithms have better performance than integrated algorithms and the algorithm which use tabu search and simulated annealing heuristics for assignment and sequencing problems consecutively is more suitable than the other algorithms. Also the numerical experiments validate the quality of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract = {Simulated Annealing (SA) is one of the oldest metaheuristics and has been adapted to solve many combinatorial optimization problems. Over the years, many authors have proposed both general and problem-specific improvements and variants of SA. We propose to accumulate this knowledge into automatically configurable, algorithmic frameworks so that for new applications that wealth of alternative algorithmic components is directly available for the algorithm designer without further manual intervention. Here, we describe SA as an ensemble of algorithmic components, and describe SA variants from the literature within these components. We show the advantages of our proposal by (i) implementing existing algorithmic components of variants of SA, (ii) studying SA algorithms proposed in the literature, (iii) improving SA performance by automatically designing new state-of-the-art SA implementations and (iv) studying the role and impact of the algorithmic components based on experimental data. Our experiments consider three common combinatorial optimization problems, the quadratic assignment problem and two variants of the permutation flow shop problem.},

Both planning too long and too short durations for surgeries lead to undesirable consequences, e.g. idle time, overtime, or rescheduling of surgeries. We define these consequences as operating room inefficiency. The overall objective of planning surgery durations is to minimize expected operating room inefficiency, since surgery durations are stochastic. While most health care studies assume economically rational behavior of decision makers, experimental studies have shown that decision makers often do not act according to economic incentives. Based on insights from health care operations management, medical decision making, behavioral operations management, as well as empirical observations, we derive hypotheses that surgeons' behavior deviates from economically rational behavior. To investigate this, we undertake an experimental study where experienced surgeons are asked to plan surgeries with uncertain durations. We discover systematic deviations from optimal decision making and offer behavioral explanations for the observed biases. Our research provides new insights to tackle a major problem in hospitals, i.e. low operating room utilization going along with staff overtime. {\copyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

This prediction is a complex exercise due to its high variability and multiple influential variables. Materials and methods: We assessed a new strategy using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and clustering methods to identify subgroups of procedures and surgeries that are combined with prediction models to improve ORT estimates. Three tree-based models are assessed, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Conditional Random Forest (CFOREST) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), under two scenarios: (i) basic dataset of predictors and (ii) complete dataset with binary procedures. To evaluate the model, we use a test dataset and a training dataset to tune parameters. Results and discussion: The best results are obtained with GBM model using the complete dataset and the grouping variables, with an operational accuracy of 57.3\% in the test set. Conclusion: The results indicate the GBM model outperforms other models and it improves with the inclusion of the procedures as binary variables and the addition of the grouping variables obtained with LCA and hierarchical clustering that perform the identification of homogeneous groups of procedures and surgeries. {\copyright} 2022, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

Between 1997 and 2012, spending on these three sectors rose by \$580~billion, and employment rose by 1.7~million people. Just under half of all 2012 revenues were spent on labor compensation. The labor compensation share of spending declined slightly; within these sectors, the share of compensation paid to physicians and nurses increased. Although employment of nonprofessional labor grew during the study period, this group did not account for much of the sector's increased spending. The plurality of the 1997--2012 spending increase went to producers of purchased materials and services, which now account for more than one-third of payments.},

Moreover, based on the problem variants considered in the collected works, a taxonomy allowing (i) the identification and positioning of each RCMPSP variant and (ii) the analysis of the current state-of-the-art of the problem is proposed.

  abstract = {Job shop scheduling (JSS) is a critical problem in the field of operations research and manufacturing, where the goal is to optimize the scheduling of jobs on machines to enhance productivity and efficiency. Combinatorial optimization problems like JSS present significant challenges due to their diverse applications and practical importance. In order to meet this challenge, metaheuristic algorithms have become extremely effective tools. They provide effective solutions that strike a balance between computational cost and solution quality. Given the Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)-hard nature of the problem, exact methods are often impractical for large instances, making metaheuristic approaches highly valuable due to their ability to find near-optimal solutions within reasonable computational times. The primary purpose of this review manuscript is to comprehensively analyze and synthesize the current state of research on metaheuristic algorithms applied to JSS. This review categorizes and summarizes contemporary metaheuristic methods such as harmony search, and ant colony optimization, alongside traditional techniques like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search, and particle swarm optimization. The fundamental concepts, key components, and typical applications of metaheuristic algorithms are explored. The paper evaluates robustness, scalability, and adaptability of different methods to different problem instances and constraints, and performance metrics, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, this paper reviews recent advancements in hybrid and multi-objective metaheuristic methods aimed at balancing scheduling constraints and improving solution quality and convergence speed. By offering a critical evaluation of the literature, this manuscript aims to identify trends, gaps, and future research directions in the application of metaheuristic algorithms to JSS. The discussion includes an exploration of emerging techniques and their potential impact on the field, as well as the practical implications for industrial applications. The conclusion of the review highlights that while significant advancements have been made, there remain numerous opportunities for innovation and improvement in developing more robust, efficient, and adaptive metaheuristic algorithms. Future research should focus on hybrid approaches, real-time scheduling, and integrating machine learning techniques to further enhance the performance and applicability of these algorithms in complex, real-world JSS problems. This comprehensive review not only serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners but also sets the stage for future innovations in the optimization of complex scheduling problems.},

Due to a computational limitation, the exact optimal model is then relaxed as a linear programming model. The output from the relaxation model then turns into the objective of the BIP-based real-time scheduling (RTS) heuristic model. The RTS heuristic requires an iteration to calculate the final C max. At each iteration, the RTS heuristic assigns just one job to the earliest available machines. Since the set of jobs and machines included in the RTS model is relatively small, RTS can be solved in a very short computational time. We evaluate an overall effectiveness (in terms of solution quality and run time) of the RTS heuristic by way of computer experiments.},

There is growing literature on improving OR efficiency, but no formal review of this topic within otolaryngology has been performed. This study reviews and synthesizes the current literature on improving OR efficiency within otolaryngology. Data Sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, preprints.org, and medRxiv were searched on November 4, 2022. Review Methods Published English studies were included if they reported on metrics for improving OR efficiency within otolaryngology. There were no publication date restrictions. Articles were screened by 2 reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis reporting for scoping reviews was followed. Results The search yielded 9316 no-duplicate articles; 129 articles were included. Most of the studies reported on head and neck procedures (n = 52/129). The main tactics included surgical considerations: hemostatic devices, techniques, and team/simultaneous approaches; anesthetic considerations: local anesthetic and laryngeal mask airways; procedure location considerations: procedures outside of the OR and remote technologies; standardization: equipment, checklists, and personnel; scheduling considerations: use of machine learning for booking, considering patient/surgeon factors, and utilizing dedicated OR time/multidisciplinary teams for on-call cases. Conclusion The current literature brings to attention numerous strategies for improving OR efficiency within otolaryngology. Applying these strategies and implementing novel techniques to manage surgical cases may assist in offloading overloaded health care systems and improving access to care while facilitating patient safety and outcomes. Anticipated barriers to implementation include resistance to change, funding, and the current strain on health care systems and providers.},

  abstract = {No-wait Flexible Flow Shop Scheduling (NWFFSSP) is one class of scheduling problems found in production scheduling. An interesting characteristic of NWFFSSP is the requirement that jobs be processed continuously without a break from one particular stage to the next. Good production scheduling considers objectives such as minimizing the total production time (makespan) and the resulting CPU Time. In this paper, NWFFSSP is solved using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) metaheuristic algorithm to minimize two objectives, namely the total production time (makespan) and CPU Time. The experimental results conclude that makespan is inversely proportional to the population size and the number of iterations. In contrast, CPU time is directly proportional to the number of whales and iterations. Compared to the other three metaheuristics, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Minimum Deviation Algorithm (MDA), WOA has the best performance in terms of makespan for small-sized problems. While in terms of time, although it does not outperform MDA, WOA is generally better than SA and GA.},

  abstract = {A common assumption in the shop scheduling literature is that the processing order of the operations of each job is sequential; however, in practice, there can be multiple connections and finish-to-start dependencies among the operations of each job. This paper studies flexible job shop scheduling problems with arbitrary precedence graphs. Rigorous mixed integer and constraint programming models are presented, as well as an evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve large-scale problems. The proposed heuristic solution framework is equipped with efficient evolution and local search mechanisms as well as new feasibility detection and makespan estimation methods. To that end, new theorems are derived that extend previous theoretical contributions of the literature. Computational experiments on existing benchmark datasets show that the proposed solution methods outperform the current state-of-the-art. Overall, 59 new best solutions and 61 new lower bounds are produced for a total of 228 benchmark problem instances of the literature. To explore the impact of the arbitrary precedence graphs, lower bounds and heuristic solutions are generated for new large-scale problems. These experiments illustrate that the machine assignment flexibility and density of the precedence graphs, affect not only the makespan, but also the difficulty of producing good upper bounds.},

  abstract = {A general framework for handling a wide range of scheduling problems arising in multiproduct/multipurpose batch chemical plants is presented. Batch processes involving a variety of complexities are represented using a state-task network. The novel feature of this representation is that both the individual batch operations (``tasks'') and the feedstocks, intermediate and final products (``states'') are included explicitly as network nodes. Processes involving sharing of raw materials and intermediates, batch splitting and mixing and recycles of material, can be represented unambiguously as such networks. The short-term scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) based on a discrete time representation. Flexible equipment allocation, variable batchsizes and mixed intermediate storage policies involving both dedicated and multipurpose storage vessels are taken into account. Limited availability of raw materials, both at the start and during the time horizon of interest, is accommodated. Product deliveries may take place at any time during the horizon, and the amounts involved may be either fixed or variable. The use of utilities by the various tasks may vary over the task processing time, and may be constant or proportional to the batchsize. The availability and/or cost of utilities may vary over the time horizon of interest. The objective function is the maximization of a profit function involving the value of the products, and the cost of raw materials, utilities and material storage. The formulation may result in MILPs involving large numbers of binary variables. Issues pertaining to the efficient solution of these problems are discussed in Part II of this paper.},

In this paper we present and evaluate four MIP formulations for the classical job shop scheduling problem (JSP). While MIP formulations for the JSP have existed since the 1960s, it appears that comprehensive computational studies have not been performed since then. Due to substantial improvements in MIP technology in recent years, it is of interest to compare the standard JSP models using modern optimization software. We perform a fully crossed empirical study of four MIP models using CPLEX, GUROBI and SCIP, focusing on both the number of instances that can be proved optimal and the solution quality over time. Our results demonstrate that modern MIP solvers are able to prove optimality for moderate-sized problems very quickly. Comparing the four MIP models, the disjunctive formulation proposed by Manne performs best on both performance measures. We also investigate the performance of MIP with multi-threading and parameter tuning using CPLEX. Noticeable performance gain is observed when compared to the results using only single thread and default parameter settings. Our results serve as a snapshot of the performance of modern MIP solvers for an important, well-studied scheduling problem. Finally, the results of MIP is compared to constraint programming (CP), another common approach for scheduling, and the best known complete algorithm to provide a broad view among different approaches.},

We develop two models, a stochastic recourse programming model and a two-stage stochastic optimization (SO) model with incorporated risk measure terms in the objective functions to determine a planning decision that is made to allocate surgical specialties to operating rooms (ORs). Our aim is to minimize the costs associated with postponements and unscheduled demands as well as the inefficient use of OR capacity. The results of these models are compared using a case of a real-life hospital to determine which model better copes with uncertainty. We propose a novel framework to transform the SO model based on its deterministic counterpart. Three SO models are proposed with respect to the variability and infeasibility of the measures of the objective function to encode the construction of the SO framework. The analysis of the experimental results demonstrates that the SO model offers better performance under a highly volatile demand environment than the recourse model. The originality of this work lies in its use of SO transformation framework and its development of stochastic models to address the problem of surgery capacity allocation based on a real case. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In this context, 140 related articles were collected and analyzed. First, the mathematical model of the FJSP and the overview framework are presented. Subsequently, five different integration models of the FJSP are explained and corresponding qualitative analyses are conducted.

Surgeries were selected from the waiting lists according to their priorities. The proposed approach considered operating theater (OT) restrictions, patients' priorities and accounted for the availability of both intensive care unit (ICU) beds and post-surgery beds. Since the management decisions of hospitals are usually made in an uncertain environment, our approach considered the uncertainty of surgery duration and availability of ICU bed. Two robust optimization approaches that kept the model computationally tractable are described and applied to deal with uncertainty.

This plan seeks to ensure the best performance and adequacy of care maximizing the use of resources, quality, equity and access. This work results from a close collaboration with a large and publicly funded Portuguese hospital. The aim is to propose a systematic approach to help the surgical planner in the scheduling of elective surgeries, in order to optimize the use of the available surgical resources, and improve equity and access to operated and waiting patients. The decisions to be taken by this surgical case assignment problem are twofold: select patients to be scheduled in the planning horizon from a large waiting list for surgery; and assign a day, an operating room, and a time block to the selected patients. Three versions are modeled in (mixed) integer linear programming: from the administration's intention up to the surgeons' current practice, and a halfway reflecting a negotiation with the surgeons. A robust approach is proposed to tackle the uncertain surgeries' duration without the need to assume a given distribution for these random parameters and allowing to control the level of conservatism in the solutions. Practical and real-sized problems from the hospital are solved providing very good optimization gaps within a short time limit, both for the deterministic and robust approaches. The schedules obtained are analyzed regarding quality and robustness, and are also compared with the surgical schedules performed by the hospital.},

The aim of this work is to provide a contribution in the field of operations research to achieve these guidelines. The operating theater is a hospital unit that represents a great proportion of the hospital budget. Furthermore, it is a central service with connections and implications in the service of many other hospital units. Therefore, this work is dedicated to a case study of an elective surgery scheduling problem arising in a Portuguese public hospital. The problem consists of assigning an intervention date, an operating room and a starting time for elective surgeries that remain in the hospital waiting list, thus combining simultaneously advance and allocation scheduling. Two conflicting optimization criteria are independently considered: maximize the surgical suite occupation and maximize the number of surgeries scheduled. Two versions of a single objective genetic heuristic are developed and applied to real data from the studied hospital. The results show that this approach improves the quality of the hospital surgical plans in light of the objectives considered, requiring much fewer resources to construct the surgical plans. Real instances with 508-2306 elective surgeries are successfully solved in less than 240s. These are better results than authors' previous approaches to the same problem. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the job-shop scheduling problem with blocking and/or no-wait constraints. A blocking constraint models the absence of storage capacity between machines, while a no-wait constraint occurs when two consecutive operations in a job must be processed without any interruption. We formulate the problem by means of a generalization of the disjunctive graph of Roy and Sussman, that we call an alternative graph, and investigate the applicability to the blocking and no-wait cases of some of the most effective ideas from the literature on the job shop with unlimited buffers. We show that several key properties, used to design heuristic procedures, do not hold in the blocking and no-wait cases, while some of the most effective ideas used to develop branch and bound algorithms can be easily extended. We presents several complexity results and solution procedures. Computational results for fast heuristics and exact algorithms are also reported.},

  abstract = {Objectives Rapid growth of Health Care Expenditures (HCE) has become one of the main challenges for the sustainability of public finances worldwide. The persistent growth of HCE and concerns about its long-term fiscal sustainability highlight the necessity for policymakers to formulate effective cost containment strategies. To this end, identifying the factors that determine the growth of HCE and their size of impact is the first and most important step in curbing HCE growth. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the factors considered as determinants of HCE at the national level and to report their significance. Methods This study reviewed the empirical literature on determinants of HCE. Electronic databases including Scopus (Elsevier), PubMed/Medline, and ISI (Web of Science) were searched to retrieve articles published until November 2017. Results Thirty six primary articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Based on the findings, a wide range of factors explaining HCE growth including socio-demographic, economic, technological, environmental and lifestyle factors, factors associated with the epidemiological transition and changing patterns of diseases, factors related to the provision for health services, and factors concerning the administration and design of the health sector. Conclusions The review suggests the need for considering a wider range of issues while investigating HCE drivers, thereby shifting from factors traditionally considered as drivers of HCE to other explaining elements that their effects on HCE growth has been rarely examined. Although the trends and determinants of HCE have been widely examined in high-income countries, limited number of studies have investigated the issue at the aggregate level in developing countries.},

However, to the best our knowledge, only one contribution has addressed the operating room planning and scheduling problem with surgical teams, but in such case surgery durations did not depend on the experience of surgeons. In this paper we address an integrated operating room planning and scheduling problem with surgical teams composed by one or two surgeons where surgery durations depend on their experience and skills. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimally solve this problem. Given the high computation requirements of our MILP model, we also propose an iterative constructive method. In order to evaluate the performance of both exact and approximate methods, an extensive test bed is generated. The computational experience shows that the proposed algorithm is able to find feasible solution for all problems requiring shorter CPU time and average relative percentage deviation than the MILP model. Finally, the robustness of the so-obtained surgical schedules is analyzed using simulation. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the operating room planning problem at the tactical and operational decision levels considering upstream and downstream units. For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is proposed for the construction of master surgical scheduling and the allocation of elective and emergency surgeries. This model encompasses the profits of all stakeholders in the operating theater. A new policy, named complete opening policy, is introduced for the management of operating rooms that has some particular benefits compared to the conventional policy. Then, a scenario-based robust formulation is proposed to consider the uncertainties of surgery duration, length of stay and emergency demands. Because the simpler variants of this problem are known to be NP-complete, a new two-stage heuristic algorithm is developed for solving its large-scale instances. During the first stage, this algorithm generates an initial solution using a greedy constructive algorithm. To improve the initial solution, the algorithm applies eight actions and searches the neighborhoods. In the second stage, the algorithm evaluates whether or not closing an operating room could improve the incumbent solution. A heuristic algorithm, named partial-mixed integer programming, is also adapted as a benchmark algorithm. This algorithm incorporates the CPLEX solver and a very large-scale neighborhood search. Eventually, a hospital in Iran is introduced and evaluated. The computational results demonstrate that the application of the proposed methodology could potentially decrease the waiting cost, the overtime and idleness of operating rooms, and the total deviation from the average beds used in upstream and downstream. The computational results also show that an increase of two beds in the intensive care unit might potentially reduce the waiting cost by 3.6\% and the total average of overtime and idleness of operating rooms each day by 20.3\%.},

Despite the theoretical interest, experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm is able to optimally solve moderate benchmark instances within a reasonable time limit. Moreover, we have shown that the use of the dominance effectively reduces the state space of the algorithm. As an extension of the DP algorithm, we also present its heuristic version. It is shown that good quality upper bounds for large-size benchmark instances can be obtained. A comparison among several algorithms presented in the literature shows that the DP algorithm is quite competitive in terms of the computational time and the quality of obtained solutions.},

We consider the integrated optimization of logistics and production costs associated with the supply chain members. These problems routinely occur in a wide variety of industries including semiconductor manufacturing, multi-tier automotive supply chains, and consumer appliances to name a few. There are two types of decision variables: binary variables for selection of companies to form the supply chain and continuous variables associated with production planning. A scenario approach is used to handle the uncertainty of demand. The formulation is a robust optimization model with three components in the objective function: expected total costs, cost variability due to demand uncertainty, and expected penalty for demand unmet at the end of the planning horizon. The increase of computational time with the numbers of echelons and members per echelon necessitates a heuristic. A heuristic based on a k-shortest path algorithm is developed by using a surrogate distance to denote the effectiveness of each member in the supply chain. The heuristic can find an optimal solution very quickly in some small- and medium-size cases. For large problems, a "good" solution with a small gap relative to our lower bound is obtained in a short computational time. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In-depth analyses of the global demand for cancer surgery and optimal workforce requirements are needed to plan service provision. We estimated the global demand for cancer surgery and the requirements for an optimal surgical and anaesthesia workforce, using benchmarks based on clinical guidelines. Methods Using models of benchmark surgical use based on clinical guidelines, we estimated the proportion of cancer cases with an indication for surgery across 183 countries, stratified by income group. These proportions were multiplied by age-adjusted national estimates of new cancer cases using GLOBOCAN 2018 data and then aggregated to obtain the estimated number of surgical procedures required globally. The numbers of cancer surgical procedures in 44 high-income countries were divided by the actual number of surgeons and anaesthetists in the respective countries to calculate cancer procedures per surgeon and anaesthetist ratios. Using the median (IQR) of these ratios as benchmarks, we developed a three-tiered optimal surgical and anaesthesia workforce matrix, and the predictions were extrapolated up to 2040. Findings Our model estimates that the number of cancer cases globally with an indication for surgery will increase by 5 million procedures (52\%) between 2018 (9\hphantom{,}065\hphantom{,}000) and 2040 (13\hphantom{,}821\hphantom{,}000). The greatest relative increase in surgical demand will occur in 34 low-income countries, where we also observed the largest gaps in workforce requirements. To match the median benchmark for high-income countries, the surgical workforce in these countries would need to increase by almost four times and the anaesthesia workforce by nearly 5{$\cdot$}5 times. The greatest increase in optimal workforce requirements from 2018 to 2040 will occur in low-income countries (from 28\hphantom{,}000 surgeons to 58\hphantom{,}000 surgeons; 107\% increase), followed by lower-middle-income countries (from 166\hphantom{,}000 surgeons to 277\hphantom{,}000 surgeons; 67\% increase). Interpretation The global demand for cancer surgery and the optimal workforce are predicted to increase over the next two decades and disproportionately affect low-income countries. These estimates provide an appropriate framework for planning the provision of surgical services for cancer worldwide.

Instances are solved by a simulated annealing metaheuristic which is further improved using efficient conditions to filter non-interesting solutions. We compare our approach to a constraint programming model using a commercial solver. Extensive experiments and statistical analysis show that our method is competitive and of practical use in the industrial context.},

  abstract = {Background: In hospital management, pinpointing steps that most enhance operating room (OR) throughput is challenging. While prior literature has utilized discrete event simulation (DES) to study specific strategies such as scheduling and resource allocation, our study examines an earlier planning phase, assessing all workflow stages to determine the most impactful steps for subsequent strategy development. Methods: DES models real-world systems by simulating sequential events. We constructed a DES model for thoracic, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic surgeries summarized from a tertiary Chinese hospital. The model covers preoperative preparations, OR occupation, and OR preparation. Parameters were sourced from patient data and staff experience. Model outcome is OR throughput. Post-validation, scenario analyses were conducted for each department, including: (1) improving preoperative patient preparation time; (2) increasing PACU beds; (3) improving OR preparation time; (4) use of new equipment to reduce the operative time of a selected surgery type; three levels of improvement (slight, moderate, large) were investigated. Results: The first three improvement scenarios resulted in a 1\%--5\% increase in OR throughput across the three departments. Large reductions in operative time of the selected surgery types led to approximately 12\%, 33\%, and 38\% increases in gastrointestinal, thoracic, and orthopedic surgery throughput, respectively. Moderate reductions resulted in 6\%--17\% increases in throughput and slight reductions of 1\%--7\%. Conclusions: The model could reliably reflect OR workflows of the three departments. Among the options investigated, model simulations suggest that improving OR preparation time and operative time are the most effective. {\copyright} 2024 International Society of Surgery/Soci{\'e}t{\'e} Internationale de Chirurgie (ISS/SIC).},

  abstract = {Introducing Lean management (LM) enables the surgical process to reach considerably high levels of performance and efficiency, in addition to increased patient safety and satisfaction among healthcare professionals. This contribution presents a consolidated model of LM which has proved highly successful in improving both overall efficiency in operation rooms and patients' perceived value of efficient hospital care. This model is based on a real case study carried out over a 3-year period. A surgical process improvement team was set up, which then designed a Process Value Flow Map using LM tools, and detected opportunities for improvement. The map reflects the patient's journey through the process, the flow of information and materials for optimising processes. Findings from the three improvement projects described in the paper were used to (1) enhance waiting list management, (2) improve operating room scheduling criteria and sharing of surgical resources, and (3) create continuous improvement teams. The results of the study are twofold: (1) reduced waiting times for operations and (2) increased efficiency of operating rooms stemming from a cultural change in surgical resources management, particularly activity planning. A notable increase in surgical efficiency indicators was also observed, as well as the need to incorporate Lean principles into surgical intervention programming.},

Most of the previous studies decompose the problem into a timetabling sub-problem and a sequencing sub-problem. Each study proposes a different sequencing and timetabling algorithm to solve the problem. In this research, this important question is aimed to be answered: is the timetabling or the sequencing algorithm more important to the effectiveness of the developed algorithm? In order to find the answer, three different sequencing algorithms are developed; a tabu search (TS), a hybrid of tabu search with variable neighbourhood search (TSVNS), and a hybrid of tabu search with particle swarm optimisation (TSPSO). Afterwards, the sequencing algorithms are combined with four different timetabling methods. All the approaches are applied to a large number of test problems available in the literature. Statistical analysis reveals that although some of the sequencing and timetabling algorithms are more complicated than the others, they are not necessarily superior to simpler algorithms. In fact, some of the simpler algorithms prove to be more effective than complicated and time-consuming methods.},

Operations research can play an important role in supporting such efforts.

  abstract = {Problem/Issue: Product costs are a portion of the annually increasing costs of medical care. With diligent analysis of product costs, including the cost of time to use the product, the surgeon can reduce these spiraling costs. The purpose of this study was to provide the surgeon with the necessary information to make informed decisions about time- and cost-efficient products. Materials and Methods: This study involved phoning, faxing, or e-mailing hospitals and anesthesia groups across the United States to obtain time-dependent costs in the hospital operating room. Operating room fees charged by the hospital and anesthesiologist professional fees are included. Various products were then relatively compared with the time needed to prepare, use, or apply the product. Time and cost factors were then compared in order to ascertain the most time- and cost-effective products. Findings: The findings revealed an average of \$62 per minute (rounded to the closest dollar) for the hospital operating room fee (range \$21.80--\$133.12) and \$4 per minute for the anesthesiologist professional fee (range \$2.20--\$6.10), with a total of \$66 per minute. This figure represents a marked increase from the 1991 rate of \$20 per minute. Generalizations from this study indicate that time-cost efficiency is seen more so in kits (trays) than in nonkits and more so in disposables than in durables. Products that require fewer people are more time-cost efficient than those that require more people, and products that require fewer steps are more time-cost efficient than those that require more steps. Specific findings included time and cost dominance for the following products: staples over sutures, direct-current cautery over alternating-current cautery, syringes over Dermajet or Madajet, MagneSplint over suturing the nasal septum, aluminum-Velcro or aluminumfoam Denver Splint and Xomed Bridgemaster over any of the polypropylene heat-sensitive splints, Rhino Rocket and Merocel over Vaseline gauze, Brennan RhinoCath over manual blood removal, 1-piece Biplane liposuction cannulas over any 2-piece type, Doyle ear-dressing kit over component parts, Dale nasal dressing over component parts, preformed implants over manual forming, and Denver Splint kits over component parts. Conclusions: Each hospital or private suite will have different charges, and the range of product choices for each surgeon will be different. However, the principle is the same: If you save time, you will save money. In addition to the monetary benefit, the patient will be safer and receive less anesthesia, and the surgeon will have more time for his or her own social or professional life. Each surgeon should analyze the product choices and choose those products that will deliver quality care in less time. To save more than \$100 000, the surgeon has to save only approximately 7 minutes per case on 250 cases.},

For FJSP, by comparing the problem group with the makespan and the mean relative errors (MREs), it was found that for small-sized Kacem problems, value adjusting with ``DE/rand/1'' and exponential crossover at position 2. Moreover, value adjusting with ``DE/best/2'' and exponential crossover at position 2 gave an MRE of 3.25. For medium-sized Brandimarte problems, value adjusting with ``DE/best/2'' and exponential crossover at position 2 gave a mean relative error of 7.11. For large-sized Dauzere-Peres and Paulli problems, value adjusting with ``DE/best/2'' and exponential crossover at position 2 gave an MRE of 4.20. From the comparison of the DE results with other methods, it was found that the MRE was lower than that found by Girish and Jawahar with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method (7.75), which the improved DE was 7.11. For large-sized problems, it was found that the MRE was lower than that found by Warisa (1ST-DE) method (5.08), for which the improved DE was 4.20. The results further showed that basic DE and improved DE with jump search are effective methods compared to the other meta-heuristic methods. Hence, they can be used to solve the FJSP.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a framework that unifies and generalizes well-known literature results related to local search for the job-shop and flexible job-shop scheduling problems. In addition to the choice of the metaheuristic and the neighborhood structure, the success of most of the influential local search approaches relies on the ability to quickly and efficiently rule out infeasible moves and evaluate the quality of the feasible neighbors. Hence, the proposed framework focuses on the feasibility and quality evaluation of a general move when solving the job-shop and flexible job-shop scheduling problems for any regular objective function. The proposed framework is valid for any scheduling problem where the defined neighborhood structure is appropriate, and each solution to the problem can be modeled with a directed acyclic graph with non-negative weights on nodes and arcs. The feasibility conditions and quality estimation procedures proposed in the literature rely heavily on information on the existence of a path between two nodes. Thus, based on an original parameterized algorithm that asserts the existence of a path between two nodes, novel generic procedures to evaluate the feasibility of a move and estimate the value of any regular objective function of a neighbor solution are proposed. We show that many well-known literature results are special cases of our results, which can be applied to a wide range of shop scheduling problems.},

  abstract = {We address an air traffic control operator (ATCo) work-shift scheduling problem. We consider a multiple objective perspective where the number of ATCos is fixed in advance and a set of ATCo labor conditions have to be satisfied. The objectives deal with the ATCo work and rest periods and positions, the structure of the solution, the number of control center changes, or the distribution of the ATCo workloads. We propose a three-phase problem-solving methodology. In the first phase, a heuristic is used to derive infeasible initial solutions on the basis of templates. Then, a multiple independent run of the simulated annealing metaheuristic is conducted aimed at reaching feasible solutions in the second phase. Finally, a multiple independent simulated annealing run is again conducted from the initial feasible solutions to optimize the objective functions. To do this, we transform the multiple to single optimization problem by using the rank-order centroid function. In the search processes in phases 2 and 3, we use regular expressions to check the ATCo labor conditions in the visited solutions. This provides high testing speed. The proposed approach is illustrated using a real example, and the optimal solution which is reached outperforms an existing template-based reference solution.},

This is a multi-objective optimization problem, as it involves identifying the best possible distribution of ATCo work and rest periods and positions, ATCo workload and control center changes in order to cover an airspace sector configuration, while, at the same time, complying with ATCo working conditions. We propose a three-phase problem-solving methodology based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) to tackle this problem. The solution structure should resemble the previous template-based solution. Initial infeasible solutions are built using a template-based heuristic in Phase 1. Then, VNS is conducted in Phase 2 in order to arrive at a feasible solution. This constitutes the starting point of a new search process carried out in Phase 3 to derive an optimal solution based on a weighted sum fitness function. We analyzed the performance in the proposed methodology of VNS against simulated annealing, as well as the use of regular expressions compared with the implementation in the code to verify the feasibility of the analyzed solutions, taking into account four representative and complex instances of the problem corresponding to different airspace sectorings.},

As part of this, hospitals are faced with the daunting task of planning operating room patients with budget, time and personnel. Most of the scheduling problems are NP-hard, so researchers have favored the development of heuristics and meta-heuristics to the detriment of exact methods. In a context where high performance computers are in continuous improvement, it is once again interesting to explore exact methods. Here we focus on developing exact methods for solving the operating room planning and scheduling problem. Our contribution is to develop first an accelerated Integer Linear Program (ILP) using the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) meta-heuristic to optimize patient waiting time according to the priority of their surgeries. Afterwards, we expose a new lower bound obtained by optimizing the patient waiting time relaxed. The experimental results validated the performance of the accelerated ILP in comparison with the original ILP. Furthermore, we have shown that the Lagrangian relaxation of the original ILP produces a lower bound of good quality. {\copyright} 2022 ACM.},

  abstract = {Scheduling for the flexible job-shop is very important in both fields of production management and combinatorial optimization. However, it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem with traditional optimization approaches owing to the high computational complexity. The combining of several optimization criteria induces additional complexity and new problems. Particle swarm optimization is an evolutionary computation technique mimicking the behavior of flying birds and their means of information exchange. It combines local search (by self experience) and global search (by neighboring experience), possessing high search efficiency. Simulated annealing (SA) as a local search algorithm employs certain probability to avoid becoming trapped in a local optimum and has been proved to be effective for a variety of situations, including scheduling and sequencing. By reasonably hybridizing these two methodologies, we develop an easily implemented hybrid approach for the multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP). The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is a viable and effective approach for the multi-objective FJSP, especially for problems on a large scale.},

Firstly, the Nawaz--Enscore--Ham (NEH) heuristic used for flow shop is extended in no-wait job shops, and an initialization scheme based on the NEH heuristic is developed to generate start solutions with a certain quality and diversity. Secondly, the iterated greedy procedure is introduced based on the destruction and construction perturbator and the insert-based local search. Furthermore, a population-based co-evolutionary scheme is presented by imposing the iterated greedy procedure in parallel and hybridizing both the left timetabling and inverse left timetabling methods. Computational results based on well-known benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two existing metaheuristics by a significant margin.},

Design/methodology/approach: A discrete-event simulation model was developed to understand how changes to the MSS would affect bed occupancy, thereby providing business intelligence for short- and long-term hospital planning. A decision tool was subsequently developed for hospital managers to test different scenarios. Findings: Simulation modelling showed that significant bed occupancy levelling could be achieved through small and practicable changes to the MSS. Optimisation routines conducted using the simulation model then gave additional insights into how the schedule should be revamped for the long term. Practical implications: The authors show how operations research methods are useful for guiding hospital operational planning. The authors show that a data-driven and evidence-based model enables hospital managers to critically explore various scheduling changes, while also providing a scientific common ground for discussion among important stakeholders. It is a crucial step forward when adopting advanced analytics for Hong Kong hospital operational planning. Originality/value: The authors provide a robust method for evaluating the relationship between Hong Kong hospital's MSS and its bed occupancy. Through simulating various changes to the surgical schedule, valuable and practicable insights were made available for hospital managers to make short- and longer-term changes that enhance the system's overall efficiency and service quality. {\copyright} 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this study, the uncertainty in parameters, such as emergency arrivals and surgery durations, has been considered. Based on the historical data obtained from a local hospital in Australia, we fitted lognormal distributions to surgery durations and Poisson distributions to emergency case arrivals. A stochastic programming model is developed to optimise the assignment of selected elective patients to surgical blocks considering the emergency arrivals with the objective of minimising the total cost of conducting or postponing surgeries and overtime. The surgical blocks are obtained from a master surgery schedule (MSS) which is determined at the tactical level of OR scheduling for several months. Each block is combinations of weekday/time, surgical specialty, and ORs. To distinguish the patients on the waiting list, a priority factor has been determined for each patient considering their surgical specialty, their actual waiting time, and their urgency level. Emergency patients have higher priority compared to the elective case with the same attributes. To preventively manage the random arrivals of emergency cases, most of the literature applied a Break-In-Moment (BIM) methodology in which finish times of surgeries in blocks are distributed in a way that maximises the insertion opportunities for emergency case arrivals. However, this methodology cannot be considered as a highly responsive-preventive methodology when the lengths of surgeries appear to be long as it may reduce opportunities for emergency case insertions. The proposed solution in this paper considers buffer time in each surgical block as a preventive methodology for emergency case arrivals. These buffer times can be divided into several parts and can be inserted into the plan every few hours, or they can be used as a whole time at the end of block time. In this paper, at first, we run the model deterministically to obtain good estimates of buffer time for each block. Then we run the model stochastically using the buffer times from the deterministic model and the random data obtained from distribution functions of the random parameters. By considering this scenario as a base, varying the buffer times and solving each scenario stochastically, we found that increasing the amounts of buffer times did not change the objective function significantly, however reducing them changed the objective function noticeably. Based on this, solving the model deterministically at first can give us a good estimation of buffer time for preventive scheduling for emergency case in flexible ORs. {\copyright} 2023 Proceedings of the International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM.

  abstract = {Objective: Assess the impact of the implementation of a data-driven scheduling strategy that aimed to improve the access to care of nonelective surgical patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Background: Between July 2009 and June 2010, MGH experienced increasing throughput challenges in its perioperative environment: approximately 30\% of the nonelective patients were waiting more than the prescribed amount of time to get to surgery, hampering access to care and aggravating the lack of inpatient beds. Methods: This work describes the design and implementation of an "open block" strategy: operating room (OR) blocks were reserved for nonelective patients during regular working hours (prime time) and their management centralized. Discrete event simulation showed that 5 rooms would decrease the percentage of delayed patients from 30\% to 2\%, assuming that OR availability was the only reason for preoperative delay. Results: Implementation began in January 2012. We compare metrics for June through December of 2012 against the samemonths of 2011. The average preoperative wait time of all nonelective surgical patients decreased by 25.5\% (P {$<$} 0.001), even with a volume increase of 9\%. The number of bed-days occupied by nonurgent patients before surgery declined by 13.3\% whereas the volume increased by 4.5\%. Conclusions: The large-scale application of an open-block strategy significantly improved the flow of nonelective patients atMGHwhen OR availability was a major reason for delay. Rigorous metrics were developed to evaluate its performance. Strong managerial leadership was crucial to enact the new practices and turn them into organizational change.

An effective method, CLLM (complete local search with limited memory), is presented by integrating with shift timetabling for the sequencing component. Experimental results show that CLLM outperforms all the existing effective algorithms for the considered problem with a little more computation time.},

  abstract = {The no-wait job shop problem that exists with makespan minimization is well known to be a strongly NP-hard problem. In this paper, the properties of the problem are analyzed according to its characteristics. The problem is remodeled based on the introduced time difference. A traditional framework is adopted by decomposing the problem into two subproblems: the sequencing and the timetabling problems. An efficient Shift Penalty-Based Timetabling method is proposed, which constructs two initial timetables from time difference-based sets and improves them by an investigated timetable tightening method. A modified complete local search with memory is presented for the sequencing problem. The whole algorithm is tested on benchmark instances and compared with the two best existing algorithms. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm performs well on both effectiveness and efficiency.},
