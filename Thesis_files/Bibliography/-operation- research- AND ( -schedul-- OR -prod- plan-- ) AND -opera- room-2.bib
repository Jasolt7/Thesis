  abstract = {This article addresses the daily scheduling of surgeries in an operating theatre. The problem consists of a set of surgical operations that have to be scheduled in identical operating rooms. The operations have uncertain durations, require setup activities before and after the surgical act and are assigned to surgeons who have to perform the surgical part. The objective is to find the best sequence of operations in each room in order to minimize the theatre’s opening duration (makespan) and the surgeons’ waiting times. A stochastic mathematical model and a simulated annealing-based algorithm, where the uncertainty is represented using the sample average approximation technique, are provided. An experimental study carried out on real-sized instances shows that the method’s solutions have respectable relative gaps in comparison with lower bounds and optimal solutions. ß 2020 Canadian Operational Research Society (CORS)},

A new model of the sequence-dependent operating room cleaning times that arise because of surgeries with different infection levels is considered. To solve this difficult integrated planning and scheduling problem, we devise a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm based on the time-indexed formulation of the problem. The basic column generation scheme relies on a label-correcting algorithm that we purposely developed for solving the pricing problems that are modeled as single operating room scheduling problems with time-dependent costs and sequence-dependent cleaning times. The pricing problems are strongly NP-Hard. The efficiency of the label-correcting algorithm is ensured by dominance rules among labels and by two algorithms for computing the upper and lower bound of labels. An effective cutting procedure, inspired by Benders’ decomposition and based on duality theory for linear programming, is developed for tightening the linear relaxation of the problem. With instances from the literature and that we generated, we conduct a numerical study to demonstrate the computational effectiveness of the solution method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, maximizing its efficiency is of vital importance since it can have impor-tant implications on cost saving and patient satisfaction. In this context, Operations Research methodologies can play a relevant role supporting hospital executives in operating room management and surgery scheduling issues. In particular, great rel-evance has been given in literature to the Surgery Scheduling Problem (SPP). In its general form, it consists in determining a day, an operating room and a starting time of a set of surgeries. In this work, we address the SPP faced by a local hospital of Naples. The aim of the hospital is to determine a surgery schedule capable of handling unforeseeable events while maximizing the number of performed surg-eries, according to some medical guidelines. This problem has been modelled by an original integer linear programming formulation that has been tested and validated on several instances derived from real data provided by the hospital. Finally, the proposed formulation can be used to simulate different surgery operating scenarios. The results of this simulation can be used to provide useful managerial insights for an efficient schedule of the hospital surgeries. © The Author(s).},

In this work, we consider one of the key sources of variability, specifically emergencies. Due to non-elective surgeries arrival, the operating room schedule has to be adjusted. Thus, need for a decision support tool, guiding the operating room manager, to handle this unpredictable flow of patients, arises. The main contribution of this work is to provide online assignment strategies, taking into account three non-elective patient's categories. The proposed assignments are riskless on patient's health. According to the non-elective surgery category, the proposed adjusted schedule minimizes different criteria, such as patient's waiting time, deviation from the scheduled start time of a surgery and the amount of resulting overtime. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The operating room is a major cost and revenue center for most hospitals. Thus, more effective operating room management and scheduling can provide significant benefits. In many hospitals, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), where patients recover after their surgical procedures, is a bottleneck. If the PACU reaches capacity, patients must wait in the operating room until the PACU has available space, leading to delays and possible cancellations for subsequent operating room procedures. We develop a generalizable optimization and machine learning approach to sequence operating room procedures to minimize delays caused by PACU unavailability. Specifically, we use machine learning to estimate the required PACU time for each type of surgical procedure, we develop and solve two integer programming models to schedule procedures in the operating rooms to minimize maximum PACU occupancy, and we use discrete event simulation to compare our optimized schedule to the existing schedule. Using data from Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford, we show that the scheduling system can significantly reduce operating room delays caused by PACU congestion while still keeping operating room utilization high: simulation of the second half of 2016 shows that our model could have reduced total PACU holds by 76\% without decreasing operating room utilization. We are currently working on implementing the scheduling system at the hospital. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We develop two models, a stochastic recourse programming model and a two-stage stochastic optimization (SO) model with incorporated risk measure terms in the objective functions to determine a planning decision that is made to allocate surgical specialties to operating rooms (ORs). Our aim is to minimize the costs associated with postponements and unscheduled demands as well as the inefficient use of OR capacity. The results of these models are compared using a case of a real-life hospital to determine which model better copes with uncertainty. We propose a novel framework to transform the SO model based on its deterministic counterpart. Three SO models are proposed with respect to the variability and infeasibility of the measures of the objective function to encode the construction of the SO framework. The analysis of the experimental results demonstrates that the SO model offers better performance under a highly volatile demand environment than the recourse model. The originality of this work lies in its use of SO transformation framework and its development of stochastic models to address the problem of surgery capacity allocation based on a real case. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The operating theater is a hospital unit that represents a great proportion of the hospital budget. Furthermore, it is a central service with connections and implications in the service of many other hospital units. Therefore, this work is dedicated to a case study of an elective surgery scheduling problem arising in a Portuguese public hospital. The problem consists of assigning an intervention date, an operating room and a starting time for elective surgeries that remain in the hospital waiting list, thus combining simultaneously advance and allocation scheduling. Two conflicting optimization criteria are independently considered: maximize the surgical suite occupation and maximize the number of surgeries scheduled. Two versions of a single objective genetic heuristic are developed and applied to real data from the studied hospital. The results show that this approach improves the quality of the hospital surgical plans in light of the objectives considered, requiring much fewer resources to construct the surgical plans.

Given the high computation requirements of our MILP model, we also propose an iterative constructive method.

Design/methodology/approach: A discrete-event simulation model was developed to understand how changes to the MSS would affect bed occupancy, thereby providing business intelligence for short- and long-term hospital planning. A decision tool was subsequently developed for hospital managers to test different scenarios. Findings: Simulation modelling showed that significant bed occupancy levelling could be achieved through small and practicable changes to the MSS. Optimisation routines conducted using the simulation model then gave additional insights into how the schedule should be revamped for the long term. Practical implications: The authors show how operations research methods are useful for guiding hospital operational planning. The authors show that a data-driven and evidence-based model enables hospital managers to critically explore various scheduling changes, while also providing a scientific common ground for discussion among important stakeholders. It is a crucial step forward when adopting advanced analytics for Hong Kong hospital operational planning. Originality/value: The authors provide a robust method for evaluating the relationship between Hong Kong hospital’s MSS and its bed occupancy. Through simulating various changes to the surgical schedule, valuable and practicable insights were made available for hospital managers to make short- and longer-term changes that enhance the system’s overall efficiency and service quality. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Planning operating theatres and scheduling surgeries play a crucial role in hospital management. Operating theatres generate the most revenue for hospitals while demanding significant resources. This study investigates the optimal plan for flexible operating rooms (ORs) as a shared resource between elective and emergency patients. Elective operations might be planned weeks or months in advance. An emergency operation, on the other hand, must be performed as soon as possible. In this study, the uncertainty in parameters, such as emergency arrivals and surgery durations, has been considered. Based on the historical data obtained from a local hospital in Australia, we fitted lognormal distributions to surgery durations and Poisson distributions to emergency case arrivals. A stochastic programming model is developed to optimise the assignment of selected elective patients to surgical blocks considering the emergency arrivals with the objective of minimising the total cost of conducting or postponing surgeries and overtime. The surgical blocks are obtained from a master surgery schedule (MSS) which is determined at the tactical level of OR scheduling for several months. Each block is combinations of weekday/time, surgical specialty, and ORs. To distinguish the patients on the waiting list, a priority factor has been determined for each patient considering their surgical specialty, their actual waiting time, and their urgency level. Emergency patients have higher priority compared to the elective case with the same attributes. To preventively manage the random arrivals of emergency cases, most of the literature applied a Break-In-Moment (BIM) methodology in which finish times of surgeries in blocks are distributed in a way that maximises the insertion opportunities for emergency case arrivals. However, this methodology cannot be considered as a highly responsive-preventive methodology when the lengths of surgeries appear to be long as it may reduce opportunities for emergency case insertions. The proposed solution in this paper considers buffer time in each surgical block as a preventive methodology for emergency case arrivals. These buffer times can be divided into several parts and can be inserted into the plan every few hours, or they can be used as a whole time at the end of block time. In this paper, at first, we run the model deterministically to obtain good estimates of buffer time for each block. Then we run the model stochastically using the buffer times from the deterministic model and the random data obtained from distribution functions of the random parameters. By considering this scenario as a base, varying the buffer times and solving each scenario stochastically, we found that increasing the amounts of buffer times did not change the objective function significantly, however reducing them changed the objective function noticeably. Based on this, solving the model deterministically at first can give us a good estimation of buffer time for preventive scheduling for emergency case in flexible ORs. © 2023 Proceedings of the International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM.
